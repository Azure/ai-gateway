# /ai-gateway:discover

Discover — and only discover — the AI assets registered in an AI Gateway. This is a
**read-only** exploration command: it lists models and MCP tool servers and helps the
user pick the ones that match their intent. It never provisions, updates, or deletes
anything, and it does **not** scaffold code (use `/ai-gateway:build` for that).

Follow the discovery workflow defined in the bundled skill
`skills/use-ai-gateway/SKILL.md` — specifically **Part 1 — Discover & select assets**:

1. Determine the target gateway from `$ARGUMENTS` if provided. Discovery goes through the
   ARM control plane, so you need the gateway's **ARM `gatewayResourceId`** — a runtime host
   alone is not enough to list assets. If only a host is given, resolve the id
   (`az resource list --name <name>`) or ask the user. If the target is missing or
   ambiguous, ask before making any call. The gateway is a `Microsoft.ApiManagement/service`
   or `Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways` resource; both work identically.
2. List the **models** in the gateway workspace and read each model's
   `properties.deployment.modelName` (the exact identifier accepted by the OpenAI
   passthrough — prefer it over the ARM `name` or `displayName`).
3. List the **MCP tool servers**, build each MCP endpoint URL as
   `https://{gateway-host}/default/toolservers/{toolServerName}/mcp` (the `/default/`
   workspace segment is required), and verify each server actually exposes tools via a
   full `initialize` → `notifications/initialized` → `tools/list` MCP handshake (carry the
   `Mcp-Session-Id` from `initialize`). Read the runtime host from the resource's
   `properties.gatewayUrl`.
4. Present a clear, grouped summary: models (id + description) and tool servers
   (name + endpoint + tool count), highlighting the best matches for the user's stated
   use case. Then ask which assets they want to use.

Stop after presenting the assets. Do not retrieve credentials or generate code unless
the user explicitly asks to continue (or runs `/ai-gateway:build`).
