# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others) working in this repository.

## Repository map

| Path | What it is | Edit? |
|---|---|---|
| `labs/` | The Azure AI Gateway hands-on labs: one folder per lab (`NN-slug/README.md`, `infra/`, optional notebook, plus the unnumbered `quickstart/`), the site engine (`site/`, `build.mjs`), tools, shared assets, and the `azure-ai-gateway-labs` agent skill | Yes. Read [`labs/AUTHORING.md`](labs/AUTHORING.md) first |
| `labs/RELEASE-NOTES.md` | The labs release notes, one section per [product release](https://ai.gateway.azure.com/docs/) | Yes |
| `docs/` | The generated labs site, served by GitHub Pages from `main` | Never by hand. `npm run build` writes it |
| `skills/use-ai-gateway/`, `commands/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.github/plugin/`, `gemini-extension.json` | The read-only coding-agent plugin that integrates an existing gateway's models and tools into apps | Only when asked |
| `cli/` | Installers and the command reference for the `az aigateway` CLI extension | Only when asked |
| `samples/` | The samples catalog | Only when asked |

## Labs essentials

Run these from `labs/` (Node.js 20 or later):

```bash
npm install
npm run releases   # product releases, and which ones labs/RELEASE-NOTES.md doesn't cover yet
npm run sync       # refresh the generated GitHub navigation in the READMEs and the skill catalog
npm run build      # sync, then write ../docs
npm run check      # strict build: must finish with zero warnings before you commit
npm run serve      # preview at http://localhost:4173/ai-gateway/
npm run deploy:swa # optional: publish to the swa-ai-gateway-labs Static Web App in rg-ai-gateway-labs
```

- Each lab's `README.md` is the single source of truth for the site, GitHub, and the agent skill. Never edit
  `docs/`, the `<!-- gh:begin -->` … `<!-- gh:end -->` regions, or lines that end with `<!-- gh -->`.
- Follow [`labs/AUTHORING.md`](labs/AUTHORING.md) for the metadata, lab anatomy, tracks, directives, writing
  style, Bicep, runtime calls, notebooks, and release notes.
- Never invent portal labels, CLI flags, JSON fields, or outputs. Verify every step on a live gateway first: the
  labs create the `Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways` resource type with API version `2025-09-01-preview`.
- Never print, commit, or screenshot keys, tokens, or connection strings. Delete the Azure resources you create to
  verify a change.
- Commit `labs/` and the regenerated `docs/` together.

## Update the labs

When the user asks to **update the labs** (or to check for new AI Gateway releases, or to align the labs with the
latest release), follow these steps.

### 1. Find the new product releases

```bash
cd labs
npm run releases
```

The tool reads the changelog from <https://ai.gateway.azure.com/docs/> and marks every release that
`RELEASE-NOTES.md` doesn't cover yet with ✗. For each one it prints the changelog entry and the full release page,
including the product docs links and the URLs of the product screenshots. The docs site is a single-page app, so
fetching a docs URL directly returns no content; use the tool instead:

- `npm run releases -- --page /docs/<page>` prints any product docs page, and `-- --pages` lists them.
- `npm run releases -- --save-bundle /tmp/aigw-docs.js` saves the docs bundle. Search it for the exact portal
  labels, hints, and error messages of a feature, for example
  `grep -o '.\{100\}Supported MCP versions.\{200\}' /tmp/aigw-docs.js`.

If every release is covered, say so. Then only refresh what the user asked for, such as changed portal labels or
newer models.

### 2. Map every change to a lab

For each product change, search the labs (`grep -il "<feature>" labs/[0-9][0-9]-*/README.md labs/quickstart/README.md`) and
`labs/catalog.json`, and choose one action:

| Status | When | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Covered | A lab already teaches it as released | Nothing, beyond checking that the labels still match |
| ✏️ Update | It extends or changes a feature that a lab teaches: a new option, a new wizard step, a renamed label | Update every affected track (portal, CLI, REST, Bicep, code, notebook), the checkpoints, troubleshooting, next steps, and the metadata (`duration`, `tags`, `objectives`) |
| 🆕 New lab | A new use case with its own outcome and at least 15 minutes of hands-on work | Use the next free number, follow the lab anatomy in `AUTHORING.md`, and add it to `catalog.json` (`paths`, `usecases`, `shortTitles`). Add a diagram in `labs/tools/diagrams/` and, when it helps, a widget |
| ➖ Not covered | It can't be practiced, or it's too minor for a lab | Say so in the release notes |

Show the user the mapping as a table and confirm it before you write, unless they asked you to go ahead.

### 3. Verify on a live gateway

Deploy a throwaway gateway with [lab 01's Bicep](labs/01-provision-gateway/infra/main.bicep), plus what the
labs need (for example a Foundry account with the lab models). Then run every new or changed step: CLI and REST
calls, `az bicep build` and a real deployment of each changed template, scripts, code samples, and notebooks.
Use the real outputs and error messages in the checkpoints and troubleshooting tables. Check portal steps in the
live portal at <https://ai.gateway.azure.com> and capture new screenshots into `labs/assets/screens/`.

### 4. Write the release notes

Add a `## <Month D, YYYY>` section at the top of `labs/RELEASE-NOTES.md`, as described in
[Release notes](labs/AUTHORING.md#release-notes):

- An `### <title>` heading that matches the product changelog title.
- A one-sentence summary and a link to `https://ai.gateway.azure.com/docs/releases/<YYYY-MM-DD>`.
- The mapping table, linking to the lab sections, and `#### Labs changes`.
- The date added to the `**Releases:**` jump line.

`npm run releases -- --check` must then exit with code 0.

### 5. Update the references

- `labs/README.md`: hand-written text that mentions the labs.
- The root `README.md`: the lab count and the use-case list.
- `labs/quickstart/`: when provisioning, the portal flow, the default model, or the runtime URL changes, update its
  portal, Azure CLI, and Bicep + azd tracks (keep them paste-ready for Cloud Shell), its azd template (`azure.yaml`
  and `infra/`, which the track gets with a sparse clone of `labs/quickstart` from `main` on GitHub; test it with
  `azd up` and `azd down --purge --force`), and the condensed output of a real CLI run that the home page shows
  (`homePage` in `labs/site/templates.mjs`).
- `labs/AUTHORING.md`: the lists of screens, diagrams, and widgets.
- `labs/skills/azure-ai-gateway-labs/SKILL.md`: the hand-written facts, when runtime behavior or lab conventions
  change. `npm run sync` regenerates its catalog.

### 6. Build, check, and ship

1. Run `npm run sync && npm run build && npm run check`, and fix every warning.
2. Preview with `npm run serve`. Check the release notes page, the **What's new** pill on the home page, and each
   changed lab in light and dark themes and at mobile width.
3. Commit `labs/`, `docs/`, and the root `README.md` with a message that names the product release, then push.
4. If the user publishes the Static Web App, run `npm run deploy:swa` and open `/release-notes/` on it.
5. Delete the verification resources (gateways, `Microsoft.Web/connectorGateways`, and Foundry accounts, purging
   soft-deleted ones) and their deployment history.

Finish with a short report: the releases handled, the labs added or updated, and any product change that no lab
covers yet.
