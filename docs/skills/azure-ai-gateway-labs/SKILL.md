# Azure AI Gateway labs

Hands-on labs for the Azure AI Gateway. Each lab is one Markdown file with a scenario, a diagram, step-by-step tasks
with checkpoints, a **Verify** section, clean-up, and troubleshooting. Most labs offer several tracks (Portal, Azure
CLI, REST, Bicep, Code), and some also ship a Jupyter notebook.

- Labs site: https://azure.github.io/ai-gateway/
- Source: https://github.com/Azure/ai-gateway/tree/main/labs
- Product docs: https://ai.gateway.azure.com/docs
- AI Gateway portal: https://ai.gateway.azure.com
- Overview on Microsoft Learn: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/ai-gateway-overview

AI Gateway is in public preview, so portal labels and API shapes can change. When a step fails, compare it with the
product docs that the lab links to before you improvise a fix.

## Where to find things

| You need | Get it from |
| :-- | :-- |
| A lab as clean Markdown, with its metadata as YAML front matter | `https://azure.github.io/ai-gateway/labs/<slug>/index.md` |
| The same lab on GitHub, with navigation and inline code | `https://github.com/Azure/ai-gateway/blob/main/labs/<slug>/README.md` |
| The lab page to share with a person | `https://azure.github.io/ai-gateway/labs/<slug>/` |
| Files the lab uses (`infra/`, the notebook) | `labs/<slug>/` in a clone, or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/ai-gateway/main/labs/<slug>/<path>` |
| Every lab in one file | `https://azure.github.io/ai-gateway/llms-full.txt` |
| Which lab covers a product release or a new feature | `https://azure.github.io/ai-gateway/release-notes/index.md`, or `labs/RELEASE-NOTES.md` in a clone |

When the workspace is a clone of `Azure/ai-gateway`, read `labs/<slug>/README.md` from disk instead.

## Run a lab with the user

1. **Pick the lab.** Match the user's goal to the [use-case map](#use-case-map) or the [catalog](#lab-catalog). Check
   what the lab needs first: the portal, CLI, and REST tracks of most labs reuse the gateway from lab 01 and the
   model from lab 02, while a lab's Bicep + azd track creates its own. For newcomers,
   suggest the 5-minute quick start, `quickstart`: in the portal, with Azure CLI commands in Cloud Shell, or with one
   `azd up` of a Bicep template that it clones from the repo, it creates a gateway, a Foundry
   model, an alias, and a runtime key with lab 02's names, so labs 03 onward work on it. Then suggest the 30-minute
   essentials path.
2. **Read the whole lab** before you run anything. **Before you begin** lists the tools, Azure roles, regions, and
   billable resources.
3. **Choose one track.** A track starts at `<!-- track: <id> | <label> -->`, and the group of tracks ends at
   `<!-- /tracks -->`. On GitHub, each track is a collapsible `<details>` section. Follow only the chosen track.
   Sections outside the track markers, such as **Verify** and **Clean up**, apply to every track. A track can end
   with its own **Clean up** step instead, as in the quick start.
4. **Fill in the placeholders:** `<subscription-id>`, `<resource-group>`, `<gateway>`, `<location>`,
   `<model-name>`, `<provider-name>`, `<foundry-account-name>`, and `<tenant-id>`. Get the values from the user or
   from `az account show`. Keep secrets in environment variables such as `$AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, and never write
   them to files, code, or chat.
5. **Go one step at a time.** Each `###` heading in a track is a step. Run it, then compare the result with the
   **Checkpoint** that follows. `<!-- include: infra/<file> -->` means the step uses that file from the lab folder.
   `<!-- widget: … -->` marks an interactive simulator on the site, which you can skip.
   `<!-- video: … -->` marks an optional narrated walkthrough; the steps in the text are complete without it.
6. **Verify** with the lab's **Verify** section, and tell the user what you checked.
7. **Clean up.** Labs create billable resources. Offer the lab's **Clean up** section, or the chosen track's
   **Clean up** step, and delete only what this lab created, because later labs reuse the gateway and the model.

Before you create, change, or delete Azure resources, confirm the subscription and resource group with the user.

| Track | Marker id | How to use it |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Portal | `portal` | Click-by-click steps in the AI Gateway portal. You can't run them from a shell, so guide the user through them one screen at a time. |
| Azure CLI | `cli` | `az aigateway` commands (extension 1.0.0b14 or later), plus `az rest` calls to Azure Resource Manager for what the extension can't do yet, in Bash and PowerShell variants. This is the easiest track for an agent to run. |
| REST API | `rest` | Raw Azure Resource Manager requests, for users who script against the API themselves. |
| Bicep + azd | `iac` | A self-contained azd template in the lab folder (`azure.yaml` and `infra/main.bicep`): clone the repo, run `azd up` in the lab folder to create a new resource group with its own gateway, model, and the lab's feature, read the outputs with `azd env get-value`, change settings with `azd env set` and `azd provision`, and delete everything with `azd down --purge --force`. Lab 09 labels its track **Policy as code** (JSON policies applied by a script), and lab 21 **Bicep** (`az deployment sub create` with parameter files). |
| Code | `code` | Python, TypeScript, and .NET clients, and agent frameworks, calling the gateway at runtime. |
| Notebook | none | `labs/<slug>/<slug>.ipynb` deploys the lab's resource-group-scoped `infra/` Bicep modules onto the notebook's gateway from Python with helpers in `labs/shared/utils.py`, then checks each step with `assert`. |

## Facts to rely on

- The gateway is the `Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways` resource, API version `2025-09-01-preview`. Never use
  `Microsoft.ApiManagement/service`. In Bicep, set `sku: { name: 'Consumption' }` (without it, the gateway is
  created in the `Premium` SKU; `az aigateway create` sets `Consumption`) and no publisher properties, and add a
  `Microsoft.Web/connectorGateways` resource with the same name (API version `2026-05-01-preview`) that depends on
  the gateway. Put `#disable-next-line BCP081` before each `aigateways` and `connectorGateways` resource
  declaration, because Bicep has no types for them. Gateway names are at most 24 characters, and a subscription
  can have at most five gateways in each region.
- The public preview runs in a growing list of regions. List them with
  `az provider show --namespace Microsoft.ApiManagement --query "resourceTypes[?resourceType=='aigateways'].locations | [0]"`
  (display names; `az account list-locations` maps them to `--location` names), as in lab 01's
  **Find the available regions**. The portal can offer fewer regions than the CLI and Bicep. Templates that deploy
  Foundry models need a region where those models are available too.
- The CLI track uses the `az aigateway` extension 1.0.0b14 or later (lab 01 installs it) for gateways, providers,
  models (`model create --deployment-config "{resourceId:…,modelName:…}"`), aliases, model policies
  (`model policy set-token-limit`, `set-content-safety`, `remove`), API keys, and MCP servers.
  `az aigateway api-key create` needs `--display-name`, secrets come from `api-key list-secrets`, rotation uses
  `api-key regenerate --key-type primary|secondary`, and `model-alias create` fails when the alias exists, so use
  `model-alias update`. `--token-counter-key` takes one value; for `[identity, ipAddress]`, use
  `model update --policies`. The track keeps `az rest` for what the extension can't do yet: gateway and workspace
  policies, telemetry exporters, MCP versions, tool rules and `failureMode`, network settings after creation, API
  key `state`, and the connector gateway. Tracks that call `az rest` set `GATEWAY_ID` (from `az aigateway show`),
  `WS` (`https://management.azure.com$GATEWAY_ID/workspaces/default`), and `API`
  (`api-version=2025-09-01-preview`) once. A `PATCH` replaces whole arrays such as `properties.policies`, so read,
  edit, then write.
- The runtime URL is `https://` plus `properties.frontend.defaultHostname`, which looks like
  `https://<gateway>.<region>-01.ai.gateway.azure.com`. A new gateway with no models answers `404`.
- Models: `<runtime URL>/default/models/openai/v1` serves OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses.
  `<runtime URL>/default/models/anthropic/v1/messages` serves Anthropic Messages.
- The labs use `gpt-6-luna` (version `2026-09-22`, `GlobalStandard`) from Foundry. It's a reasoning model: Chat
  Completions rejects `max_tokens` (send `max_completion_tokens`) and accepts `temperature` only with
  `reasoning_effort: "none"`. At the default effort, reasoning can use the whole token budget and leave the reply
  empty, so the scripts send `reasoning_effort: "none"` when they cap tokens. Claude Sonnet 5.5 and Haiku 5.5
  think by default, so read the `text` blocks in `content` and leave headroom in `max_tokens`.
- MCP tools: `<runtime URL>/default/toolservers/<name>/mcp`. Federated tools are named `<namespace>_<tool>`, for
  example `learn_microsoft_docs_search`.
- Runtime auth for models: a runtime API key in the `api-key` header, or `Authorization: Bearer` with the key or a
  Microsoft Entra token. Never send both, or the gateway answers `400`. With an OpenAI SDK, pass the key as the
  client's API key. MCP endpoints read keys only from `api-key`.
- Entra tokens use the audience `https://azure-api.net/aigateway`. The data-plane roles are **AI Gateway User**
  (models and tools), **AI Gateway Models User**, and **AI Gateway Tools User**.
- Policy changes take 20 to 60 seconds to apply. A token or request rate limit answers `429` with `Retry-After`, a
  cost budget answers `403` `LlmCostQuotaExceeded`, and content safety blocks with `400`.
- Streaming (`"stream": true`) returns `text/event-stream` chunks and ends with `data: [DONE]`. Chat Completions
  sends a usage chunk with empty `choices` only when the client sets `stream_options.include_usage`, and
  `stream_options` without `stream` answers `400`. The gateway counts the tokens of every stream for limits,
  budgets, and Monitoring either way. A limited caller gets a JSON `429` before the stream starts, and a stream that
  already started finishes.
- GitHub Copilot (VS Code, CLI, SDK, and the GitHub Copilot app) can use a gateway model with bring your own key: base
  URL `<runtime URL>/default/models/openai/v1`, the Responses API, a runtime key sent as a bearer token, and the alias
  as the model ID. The gateway doesn't serve `GET /models` (it answers `400`), so add models by hand. Name the alias
  after a well-known model, such as `gpt-6-astra`, so Copilot applies that model's prompts and token sizes. Agent
  requests carry 14,000 to 38,000 input tokens each, so give Copilot keys a generous token limit.
- The same Copilot clients can use a gateway MCP server, such as `learn`, at `<runtime URL>/default/toolservers/<name>/mcp`
  with the same runtime key in the `api-key` header (a bearer token answers `401`). Add it with
  `copilot mcp add --transport http --header 'api-key: ${AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY}' <name> <url>` (the CLI and the GitHub
  Copilot app share `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`), a `.vscode/mcp.json` `http` server with a password input, or
  `mcpServers` in an SDK session. Tool results add tokens: a Learn search returns 26 to 52 KB, so one question with
  a search can send about 50,000 input tokens. Suspending the key returns `401` for both models and tools.

## Notebooks

The notebooks share one gateway, so run lab 01, then lab 02, then any other notebook. Each one deploys its lab's
Bicep files (`labs/<slug>/infra/*.bicep`) with `az deployment group create`, through the shared helpers in
`labs/shared/utils.py`, so run it from its lab folder in a clone. They need Python 3.10 or later and `az login`, and
the first cell installs the packages they use. These defaults can be overridden with environment variables before
the kernel starts:

| Setting | Default | Environment variable |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Resource group | `rg-ai-gateway-labs` | `AIGW_RESOURCE_GROUP` |
| Gateway name | `aigw-labs-` plus 6 characters of the SHA-1 of the subscription ID | `AIGW_GATEWAY_NAME` |
| Region | `eastus2` | `AIGW_LOCATION` |
| Foundry account for lab 02 | `aigwlabs` plus 8 characters of the same hash, created by the notebook | `AIGW_FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT` |
| Foundry account's resource group | the labs resource group | `AIGW_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_GROUP` |

To run a notebook headless, `cd labs/<slug>` and use
`jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute <slug>.ipynb --output <copy>.ipynb`. Each notebook ends with a
**Clean up** step.

## Change or add a lab

In a clone of `Azure/ai-gateway`, edit only `labs/<slug>/README.md`, following `labs/AUTHORING.md`. Then run
`npm run sync` and `npm run check` in `labs/`. Never edit `docs/` or the generated `<!-- gh:begin -->` regions by
hand. `npm run sync` also regenerates the catalog, paths, and use-case map in this skill.

When the user asks to update the labs for new product releases, follow the "Update the labs" workflow in the
repository's `AGENTS.md`: `npm run releases` lists the product releases that `labs/RELEASE-NOTES.md` doesn't cover
yet.
