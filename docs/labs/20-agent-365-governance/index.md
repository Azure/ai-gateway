# Govern MCP servers with Agent 365

Your platform team runs the gateway, but the people who decide which tools agents may use sit in IT and security,
and they work in the Microsoft 365 admin center, not in Azure. When a tool is found to be risky, they need to
switch it off across every gateway in minutes, without filing a ticket. In this lab you connect Microsoft Agent
365 to your gateways, block one tool and then a whole MCP server from the admin center, and watch the gateway
enforce each decision on live traffic.

![Microsoft Agent 365 keeps the inventory and the decisions, and the gateway enforces them inline on MCP traffic](../assets/diagrams/agent-365.svg "Agent 365 defines governance intent, inventory, and access decisions. API Management enforces them on every request to the MCP server.")

<!-- widget: tool-patterns {"tools":["learn_microsoft_docs_search","learn_microsoft_code_sample_search","learn_microsoft_docs_fetch"],"allow":["learn_microsoft_docs_search","learn_microsoft_code_sample_search","learn_microsoft_docs_fetch"],"block":["learn_microsoft_docs_fetch"]} -->

## Before you begin

- Complete [Federate MCP tools behind one endpoint](../04-federate-mcp-tools/README.md) and
  [Control which tools agents can call](../05-mcp-tool-controls/README.md). This lab governs the `learn` MCP
  server, and you edit its **Tool availability** the same way you did in lab 05.
- A Microsoft Agent 365 tenant, and a **tenant administrator** who can grant tenant-level consent in the
  [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). After consent, Agent 365 administrators don't need
  Azure permissions of their own.
- Permission to edit the MCP server in the AI Gateway portal, for example **Contributor** on the gateway's resource
  group, and a runtime API key from **Access** › **Keys**.
- For the test script: `curl` and `jq` (Bash) or PowerShell 7 or later. Get the gateway URL from the portal or
  with the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) 2.75 or later, signed in with
  `az login`, and the `aigateway` extension ([install it](../01-provision-gateway/README.md#before-you-begin)).

> [!NOTE]
> The Agent 365 integration is an emerging preview capability. Labels and behavior can change; see the
> [release note](https://ai.gateway.azure.com/docs/releases/2026-10-08-agent-365). AI Gateway itself is free
> during the preview; Agent 365 is licensed separately.

Set these variables once. The steps and the **Verify** section reuse them.

```bash title="Bash"
export RG="<resource-group>"
export GATEWAY="<gateway>"
export MCP_SERVER="learn"

export AI_GATEWAY_URL="https://$(az aigateway show -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" --query properties.frontend.defaultHostname -o tsv)"
# Paste the runtime key you created in Access › Keys. Don't commit it or write it to a file.
read -rsp "AI Gateway API key: " AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && echo
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
$RG         = "<resource-group>"
$GATEWAY    = "<gateway>"
$MCP_SERVER = "learn"

$env:AI_GATEWAY_URL = "https://$(az aigateway show -g $RG -n $GATEWAY --query properties.frontend.defaultHostname -o tsv)"
# Paste the runtime key you created in Access › Keys. Don't commit it or write it to a file.
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = Read-Host "AI Gateway API key" -MaskInput
```

## How it works

The integration separates governance from enforcement. **Microsoft Agent 365** keeps the inventory and the access
decisions. **Azure API Management** enforces them inline on every request to an MCP server, and emits runtime
signals for auditing and investigation.

After a tenant administrator consents once, Agent 365 discovers `Microsoft.ApiManagement` resources across the
tenant's subscriptions, including subscriptions you add later, and lists their MCP servers and tools with metadata
such as endpoints, access scopes, and service identities. When an administrator blocks a server or a tool, Agent
365 uses API Management control-plane operations to insert a **managed policy** into that server. Unblocking
removes it. Existing agents keep using the same gateway endpoints.

| Control | Where you set it | What callers get |
|---|---|---|
| Block a tool (Agent 365) | Admin center › **Agents** › **Tools** › server › **Tools** tab | HTTP `200`, `isError: true`, denial code `ToolNotAvailable` |
| Block a server (Agent 365) | Admin center › **Agents** › **Tools** › server › **Block** | HTTP `403`, error code `AccessBlockedByGateway` |
| **Blocked tools** (gateway) | AI Gateway portal › MCP server › **Tools** step | The tool stays visible, but the gateway blocks its execution |
| **MCP server access** (gateway) | AI Gateway portal › MCP server › **Basic info** step | **Blocked** servers can't be reached by clients |

Tool-level blocking needs a **static list of allowed tools** on the server, so Agent 365 can read the tool list.
It isn't available for servers with dynamic allowed tools, such as **Allow all tools**.

| Capability | API Management v2 tiers | AI Gateway tier |
|---|---|---|
| Centralized MCP server inventory | Yes | Yes |
| Block or unblock MCP servers | Yes | Yes |
| Tool-level blocking | No | Yes |
| Tool activity observability | No | Yes |
| Tool threat protection | No | Yes |

API Management v1 tiers aren't supported.

## Publish a static list of allowed tools

Agent 365 can only list and block individual tools when the MCP server publishes a fixed set of tools. You set
that in the AI Gateway portal.

<!-- steps -->

### Open the Tools step

Open the [AI Gateway portal](https://ai.gateway.azure.com) and select your gateway from the gateway switcher.
Select **MCP servers**, then `learn`, then **Edit**, and go to the **Tools** step.

### Select exact tools

Under **Tool availability**, choose **Select exact tools**, and select the three `learn_` tools:
`learn_microsoft_docs_search`, `learn_microsoft_code_sample_search`, and `learn_microsoft_docs_fetch`.
Leave **Blocked tools** empty, so the only blocks in this lab come from Agent 365. Select **Save**.

If your portal doesn't offer **Select exact tools** yet, Agent 365 can't read this server's tool list. You can
still block the whole server from Agent 365, and block single tools under **Blocked tools** in the AI Gateway
portal, as in [lab 05](../05-mcp-tool-controls/README.md).

### Check the catalog

List the tools through the gateway. The script runs the MCP handshake with your runtime key and prints the
gateway's answer even when a call is blocked.

<!-- include: infra/call-tool.sh -->

On GitHub, open [infra/call-tool.sh](infra/call-tool.sh) or [infra/call-tool.ps1](infra/call-tool.ps1).

```bash
chmod +x infra/call-tool.sh
./infra/call-tool.sh "$MCP_SERVER"
```

```powershell
./infra/call-tool.ps1 -Server $MCP_SERVER
```

```text title="Expected output"
MCP endpoint: https://<gateway>.eastus2-01.ai.gateway.azure.com/default/toolservers/learn/mcp
tools/list: HTTP 200
  learn_microsoft_docs_search
  learn_microsoft_code_sample_search
  learn_microsoft_docs_fetch
```

<!-- /steps -->

> **Checkpoint**
> The `learn` server publishes exactly the tools you selected.

## Connect Agent 365 to your gateways

A tenant administrator grants consent once. The consent gives the Agent 365 service identity the **A365 MCP
Gateway Policy Operator** Azure role at tenant level, which lets it read API Management resources, read and write
API-scoped policies, and discover supported resources in existing and future subscriptions in the tenant.

<!-- steps -->

### Grant consent

Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as a tenant administrator. Under
**Agents**, select **Settings**, then **Gateways**. Turn on **Azure API Management service and AI Gateway**. By
consenting, you let the organization read the tools published through the gateway.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The consent covers every API Management instance in the tenant, not just this gateway, and lets Agent 365
> change API-scoped policies. Agree on who may block servers and tools in Agent 365 before you turn it on.

### Find your MCP server

Under **Agents**, select **Tools**. Search for `learn`, or look for servers whose publisher is **AI Gateway**.
Select the server to see its metadata, such as its endpoint, access scope, and service identity.

<!-- /steps -->

> **Checkpoint**
> The `learn` server from your gateway is in the Agent 365 inventory, with **AI Gateway** as its publisher.

## Block a tool

Your security team decides that agents shouldn't fetch arbitrary pages. You turn off one tool and leave the rest
of the server working.

<!-- steps -->

### Turn off the tool in Agent 365

In the admin center, under **Agents**, select **Tools**, then the `learn` server. Select the **Tools** tab and
disable `learn_microsoft_docs_fetch`. Agent 365 inserts a managed policy into the server to stop that tool from
running.

### Call the blocked tool

```bash
./infra/call-tool.sh "$MCP_SERVER" learn_microsoft_docs_fetch \
  '{"url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/agent-365"}'
```

```powershell
./infra/call-tool.ps1 -Server $MCP_SERVER -Tool learn_microsoft_docs_fetch `
  -Arguments '{"url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/agent-365"}'
```

```text title="Expected output"
...
tools/call: learn_microsoft_docs_fetch {"url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/agent-365"}
HTTP status: 200
isError: true
Denial code: ToolNotAvailable
Correlation ID: <guid>
Tool 'learn_microsoft_docs_fetch' is blocked by the gateway. Do not retry this tool.
```

The message text can differ; the denial code is what matters. The call returns HTTP `200` with a JSON-RPC
result, not an HTTP error. The `isError` flag and the "Do not retry" text tell the agent the tool is off on
purpose, so a well-behaved agent stops retrying it. The documented response, for a tool named `delete_file`, is:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 42,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "Tool 'delete_file' is blocked by the gateway. Do not retry this tool." }
    ],
    "isError": true,
    "_meta": {
      "com.microsoft.azure.ai.gateway/denial": {
        "code": "ToolNotAvailable",
        "correlationId": "9f2c1b6e-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Call a tool that's still allowed

```bash
./infra/call-tool.sh "$MCP_SERVER" learn_microsoft_docs_search '{"query":"What is Microsoft Agent 365?"}'
```

```powershell
./infra/call-tool.ps1 -Server $MCP_SERVER -Tool learn_microsoft_docs_search `
  -Arguments '{"query":"What is Microsoft Agent 365?"}'
```

The search returns results with `isError: false`.

### Turn the tool back on

In the admin center, on the `learn` server's **Tools** tab, enable `learn_microsoft_docs_fetch` again.

<!-- /steps -->

> **Checkpoint**
> While the tool was off, calls to it returned `ToolNotAvailable` and the other tools kept working.

## Block the whole server

During an incident, you may need to cut off every tool on a server at once. Blocking the server in Agent 365
inserts a managed `return-response` policy at the start of the server's inbound policy, so the gateway answers
before it reaches any backend.

<!-- steps -->

### Block the server in Agent 365

In the admin center, under **Agents**, select **Tools**, select the `learn` server, and select **Block**.

### Try to connect

```bash
./infra/call-tool.sh "$MCP_SERVER"
```

```powershell
./infra/call-tool.ps1 -Server $MCP_SERVER
```

```text title="Expected output"
MCP endpoint: https://<gateway>.eastus2-01.ai.gateway.azure.com/default/toolservers/learn/mcp
initialize: HTTP 403 (x-correlation-id: <guid>)
{
  "error": {
    "code": "AccessBlockedByGateway",
    "message": "Access to server 'learn' is blocked.",
    "target": "learn",
    "correlationId": "<guid>"
  }
}
```

The message names your server. Every request to the server, including `initialize` and `tools/list`, now
returns `403`.

### Unblock the server

In the admin center, select the `learn` server again and unblock it. Agent 365 removes the managed policy, and
the script lists the tools again.

<!-- /steps -->

> **Checkpoint**
> While the server was blocked, every request returned `403 AccessBlockedByGateway`. After you unblocked it, the
> handshake and `tools/list` succeed.

## Verify

<!-- steps -->

### Confirm the inventory

In the admin center, under **Agents** › **Tools**, the `learn` server is listed with **AI Gateway** as its
publisher, isn't blocked, and its **Tools** tab shows all three tools enabled.

### Confirm the server works end to end

```bash
./infra/call-tool.sh "$MCP_SERVER" learn_microsoft_docs_search '{"query":"What is Microsoft Agent 365?"}'
```

```powershell
./infra/call-tool.ps1 -Server $MCP_SERVER -Tool learn_microsoft_docs_search `
  -Arguments '{"query":"What is Microsoft Agent 365?"}'
```

`tools/list` returns the three tools, and the search returns `isError: false`.

### Trace a denial

Each denial carries a correlation ID, in the `x-correlation-id` response header and in the response body. Record
it with the agent's logs, so you can match a blocked call with the gateway's runtime signals. If you set up
Application Insights in [Monitor usage, cost, and traces](../13-monitoring/README.md), **Monitoring** › **Tools**
shows the server's tool executions and **Traces** shows each request.

<!-- /steps -->

## Go further

- **Close the side door.** Agent 365 doesn't route agents through the gateway for you. Each agent must use the
  gateway's MCP endpoint, and a block only works if agents can't reach the MCP server directly. Restrict the
  backend so the gateway is its only caller, for example with
  [private networking](../18-private-networking/README.md).
- **Add threat protection.** On the AI Gateway tier, add
  [Agent 365 tool threat protection](../19-tool-threat-protection/README.md) so Microsoft Defender and Microsoft
  Purview evaluate the calls that you allow.
- **Decide who owns which switch.** Agent 365 blocks are tenant-wide governance decisions. The gateway's own
  **Blocked tools** and **MCP server access** settings belong to the platform team. Write down which team uses
  which control, so a block set in one place isn't undone in the other.
- **Govern every server the same way.** Prefer **Select exact tools** for servers that Agent 365 governs. New
  tools then stay unpublished until someone reviews and adds them.

## Clean up

<!-- steps -->

### Clear Agent 365 blocks

In the admin center, make sure the `learn` server isn't blocked and all its tools are enabled. The gateway
consent is tenant-wide, so leave it on if your organization plans to keep using the integration. Otherwise, ask a
tenant administrator to review **Azure API Management service and AI Gateway** under **Agents** › **Settings** ›
**Gateways**.

### Restore the tool availability

In the AI Gateway portal, open **MCP servers** › `learn` › **Edit** › **Tools**. Select **Allow all tools**, then
select **Save**.

<!-- /steps -->

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The gateway's MCP servers don't appear under **Agents** › **Tools** | Consent isn't granted, or the instance is on an API Management v1 tier | Have a tenant administrator turn on **Azure API Management service and AI Gateway** under **Agents** › **Settings** › **Gateways**. Use a v2 tier or the AI Gateway tier. |
| The server's **Tools** tab can't list its tools | The server doesn't have a static list of allowed tools, for example it uses **Allow all tools** | In the AI Gateway portal, choose **Select exact tools** on the server's **Tools** step. Otherwise, block tools in the AI Gateway portal. |
| You can't block individual tools | The instance is on an API Management v2 tier | Tool-level blocking needs the AI Gateway tier. Block the whole server instead. |
| A blocked tool still runs for some agents | Those agents call the MCP server directly, not through the gateway | Point every agent at the gateway's MCP endpoint and restrict direct access to the backend |
| An agent keeps retrying a blocked tool | The agent ignores `isError` | Check `result.isError` and the `ToolNotAvailable` denial code, and stop retrying that tool |
| Calls still fail after you unblock | Another control blocks them, such as the gateway's **Blocked tools**, **MCP server access**, or a policy | Check the server's **Basic info** and **Tools** steps and its policies in the AI Gateway portal |
