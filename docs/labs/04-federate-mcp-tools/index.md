# Federate MCP tools behind one endpoint

Your agent teams want tools: documentation search, ticketing, internal APIs. If every agent connects to every
tool server directly, you end up with credentials in many places and no single point of control. In this lab
the platform team publishes **one governed MCP endpoint** on the gateway, starting with the public Microsoft
Learn MCP server, so agents get tools through the same front door they already use for models.

![One MCP endpoint on the gateway federates tools from several backends](../assets/diagrams/mcp-federation.svg "Clients connect to one MCP endpoint. The gateway authenticates them, applies policies, and federates the namespaced tools of every backend.")

## Before you begin

<!-- setup: tools sign-in extension clone -->

> [!TIP]
> On the **Bicep + azd** track, `azd up` creates its own gateway, the `learn` MCP server, and a key, so you can skip
> this section. You need only the one-time setup above.

- Complete [Provision your AI Gateway](../01-provision-gateway/README.md).
- A runtime API key, for example `app-first-call` from [lab 02](../02-first-model-call/README.md). If you don't have
  one yet, create it in the portal under **Access** › **Keys**, or, after
  you set the variables below, run
  `az aigateway api-key create -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n app-first-call --display-name app-first-call`
  and read its value with
  `az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n app-first-call --query primaryKey -o tsv`.
- For the Code track: Python 3.10 or later and, optionally, VS Code.
- Permission to change the gateway, for example **Contributor** on the resource group.
- Run the scripts and samples from the lab's folder, `~/ai-gateway/labs/04-federate-mcp-tools`.

Set these variables once. Every track and the **Verify** section reuse them.

```bash title="Bash"
# Name your gateway and its resource group
export RG="<resource-group>"
export GATEWAY="<gateway>"
echo "📝 Gateway $GATEWAY in $RG"

# Read the gateway's resource ID, for the management API calls that later sections make with az rest
export API="api-version=2025-09-01-preview"
export GATEWAY_ID="$(az aigateway show -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" --query id -o tsv)"
export WS="https://management.azure.com$GATEWAY_ID/workspaces/default"
echo "🆔 Gateway: $GATEWAY_ID"

# Read the gateway's runtime URL, which MCP clients call
export AI_GATEWAY_URL="https://$(az aigateway show -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" --query properties.frontend.defaultHostname -o tsv)"
echo "🌐 Runtime URL: $AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Paste the runtime key you created in Access › Keys. Don't commit it or write it to a file.
read -rsp "AI Gateway API key: " AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && echo
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Name your gateway and its resource group
$RG         = "<resource-group>"
$GATEWAY    = "<gateway>"
Write-Host "📝 Gateway $GATEWAY in $RG"

# Read the gateway's resource ID, for the management API calls that later sections make with az rest
$API        = "api-version=2025-09-01-preview"
$GATEWAY_ID = az aigateway show -g $RG -n $GATEWAY --query id -o tsv
$WS         = "https://management.azure.com$GATEWAY_ID/workspaces/default"
Write-Host "🆔 Gateway: $GATEWAY_ID"

# Read the gateway's runtime URL, which MCP clients call
$env:AI_GATEWAY_URL = "https://$(az aigateway show -g $RG -n $GATEWAY --query properties.frontend.defaultHostname -o tsv)"
Write-Host "🌐 Runtime URL: $env:AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Paste the runtime key you created in Access › Keys. Don't commit it or write it to a file.
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = Read-Host "AI Gateway API key" -MaskInput
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

## How it works

An **MCP server** in AI Gateway is a federation point. You give it one or more **backends**, and the gateway
publishes all their tools at one Streamable HTTP endpoint:
`https://<gateway>.eastus2-01.ai.gateway.azure.com/default/toolservers/<server-name>/mcp`.

| Backend type | What you provide | What clients see |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP server** (remote) | A URL that speaks SSE or Streamable HTTP | The server's tools |
| **OpenAPI spec** | A JSON or YAML OpenAPI document (upload, URL, or inline) | Selected operations as tools. The operation summary or description becomes the tool description. |
| **Built-in connector** | A managed connection to a SaaS app, such as Microsoft 365, SharePoint, GitHub, or Salesforce | The connector's operations as tools |
| **Foundry Toolbox** | A Microsoft Foundry Toolbox source | The toolbox's tools |

Each backend can have a **namespace**. The gateway prefixes that backend's tools with it, as in
`learn_microsoft_docs_search`, so two backends can expose tools with the same name without conflict.

The gateway authenticates **clients**. In this lab they send a runtime key in the `api-key` header.
It authenticates to each **backend** separately, with **None**, **API key** (a header name and value),
**OAuth 2.0**, or **Managed identity**. Backend credentials are stored securely, are never exposed to clients,
and appear under **Connections**.

> [!NOTE]
> Registering a backend doesn't mean that AI Gateway translates every backend protocol into MCP. Pick the
> backend type that matches what the backend actually serves.

## Register the Learn MCP server

Pick one track. Each track creates the same MCP server: **`learn`**, with one backend, the public Microsoft
Learn MCP server at `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`, under the namespace `learn`. That server needs no
credentials, so the backend authentication is **None**.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Start the workflow

Open the [AI Gateway portal](https://ai.gateway.azure.com) and select your gateway from the gateway switcher.
Select **MCP servers** › **Add MCP server**. The full-page **Create MCP server** workflow has three steps:
**Basic info**, **Backends**, and **Tools**.

### Describe the server

On **Basic info**, set:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `learn` (part of the endpoint URL; it can't be changed after creation) |
| **Display name** | `Microsoft Learn` |
| **Description** | `Search and fetch official Microsoft documentation and code samples.` |

Agents and people read the description to decide when to use the server, so keep it specific. Select **Next**.

### Add the Learn backend

On **Backends**, select **Add backend**. In **Choose a backend type**, select **MCP server**, then set:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **URL** | `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp` |
| **Namespace** | `learn` |
| **Authentication** | **None** |

The backend appears in the table with its **URL**, **Type**, **Authentication**, **Namespace**, and
**Required** columns. Leave **Required** on. Select **Next**.

### Publish all tools

On **Tools**, under **Tool availability**, keep **Allow all tools** ("Expose every tool from these backends,
including tools added in the future."). You narrow this down in
[Control which tools agents can call](../05-mcp-tool-controls/README.md). Select **Create**.

### Copy the endpoint

The server's details page opens. When **Provisioning** shows that the server is ready, copy the
**Endpoint URL**. It ends in `/default/toolservers/learn/mcp`.

> **Checkpoint**
> **MCP servers** lists `learn`, and its details page shows an **Endpoint URL** and one backend with the
> namespace `learn`.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Create the registration

`az aigateway mcp create` registers the MCP server. `--endpoints` takes the backends as a JSON array.

```bash title="Bash"
# Register the learn MCP server, with the public Learn MCP server as its one backend, under the namespace learn
az aigateway mcp create -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n learn \
  --display-name "Microsoft Learn" \
  --description "Search and fetch official Microsoft documentation and code samples." \
  --endpoints '[{"kind": "mcp", "namespace": "learn", "required": true,
                 "mcp": {"url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp", "transport": "streamableHttp"}}]' \
  --query "{name:name,mcpEndpoint:properties.gatewayEndpoints[0].url}" &&
  echo "🔌 MCP server learn is ready"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Write the backends to a file, so that PowerShell passes the JSON to az unchanged
ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 -Compress -InputObject @(
  @{ kind = 'mcp'; namespace = 'learn'; required = $true
     mcp  = @{ transport = 'streamableHttp'; url = 'https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp' } }
) | Set-Content -Path endpoints.json

# Register the learn MCP server, with the public Learn MCP server as its one backend, under the namespace learn
az aigateway mcp create -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n learn `
  --display-name "Microsoft Learn" `
  --description "Search and fetch official Microsoft documentation and code samples." `
  --endpoints "@endpoints.json" `
  --query "{name:name,mcpEndpoint:properties.gatewayEndpoints[0].url}"
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔌 MCP server learn is ready" }
Remove-Item endpoints.json
```

`-n learn` is the MCP server name. `mcp create` fails with `This MCP registration already exists; use mcp update.`
if the name is taken, so change an existing registration with `az aigateway mcp update` or the `mcp source`
commands, as in the next section.

### Confirm the registration

The commands are the same in Bash and PowerShell.

```bash
# List the MCP servers on your gateway
echo "🔌 MCP servers on your gateway:"
az aigateway mcp list -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -o table

# Show the backends and the endpoint URL of learn
echo "🔌 Backends and endpoint of learn:"
az aigateway mcp show -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n learn --query "properties.{endpoints:endpoints,url:gatewayEndpoints[0].url}"
```

> **Checkpoint**
> The table shows `learn` with `Microsoft Learn` in the **DisplayName** column and `1` in the **Sources** column.
> The second command returns one endpoint with `"namespace": "learn"` and `"kind": "mcp"`, and a `url` that ends
> in `/default/toolservers/learn/mcp`.

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

**What you need:** only the one-time setup from **Before you begin**. This track doesn't use your gateway from lab 01:
`azd up` creates a new one, so it works on its own.

### Review the templates

`infra/main.bicep` creates the resource group `rg-<environment name>` and calls lab 01's
[gateway.bicep](../01-provision-gateway/infra/gateway.bicep) for a gateway with no model. Then it calls
`infra/tool-server.bicep` for the `learn` MCP server and the `app-first-call` key. azd fills the `secondNamespace`
and `supportedVersions` parameters from the environment values `MCP_SECOND_NAMESPACE` and `MCP_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS`,
which the next sections set. Empty, they register one backend and keep the legacy MCP versions.

<!-- include: infra/main.bicep -->

`infra/tool-server.bicep` references the gateway and its `default` workspace, then declares one `toolServers`
resource and, when `apiKeyName` is set, the runtime key. The key's value is never an output. You can also deploy
the module on its own to a gateway you already have, with `az deployment group create`, as lab 24 does.

<!-- include: infra/tool-server.bicep -->

> [!WARNING]
> A Bicep deployment sends a `PUT`, which replaces the whole MCP server, including backends and tool rules
> that you added in the portal. Keep the template as the only source of truth for this server, and change it with
> `azd provision`.

### Deploy with azd up

Move into the lab's folder, create an azd environment named `aigw-lab04` in your current subscription, then provision
everything. It takes about three minutes.

```bash title="Bash"
# Move into the lab's folder, which holds the azd project
cd ~/ai-gateway/labs/04-federate-mcp-tools &&
  echo "📂 Lab folder: $(pwd)"

# Create an azd environment in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab04 --location eastus2 --subscription "$(az account show --query id --output tsv)" &&
  echo "📝 azd environment aigw-lab04 deploys to eastus2"

# Provision the gateway, the learn MCP server, and the app-first-call key
azd up &&
  echo "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Move into the lab's folder, which holds the azd project
Set-Location ~/ai-gateway/labs/04-federate-mcp-tools
if ($?) { Write-Host "📂 Lab folder: $(Get-Location)" }

# Create an azd environment in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab04 --location eastus2 --subscription (az account show --query id --output tsv)
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 azd environment aigw-lab04 deploys to eastus2" }

# Provision the gateway, the learn MCP server, and the app-first-call key
azd up
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)" }
```

For another region, use its name from [Find the available
regions](../SETUP.md#find-the-available-regions).

### Read the outputs and the key

Set the variables that the next sections and **Verify** use from azd's environment values, and read the key from
the gateway, so that it never shows on screen.

```bash title="Bash"
# Read the template's outputs: the resource group, the gateway, and its runtime URL
export RG="$(azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)"
export GATEWAY="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_NAME)"
export AI_GATEWAY_URL="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)"
echo "📝 Gateway $GATEWAY in $RG"
echo "🌐 Runtime URL: $AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Read the gateway's runtime key from the gateway, so that it never lands in a file or a deployment log
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$(az aigateway api-key list-secrets --ids "$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_ID)/apiKeys/app-first-call" \
  --query primaryKey --output tsv)"
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"

# Print the endpoint of the learn MCP server, which MCP clients call
echo "🌐 MCP endpoint: $(azd env get-value MCP_ENDPOINT)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Read the template's outputs: the resource group, the gateway, its runtime URL, and its resource ID
$RG                     = azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
$GATEWAY                = azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_NAME
$env:AI_GATEWAY_URL     = azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL
$GATEWAY_ID             = azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_ID
Write-Host "📝 Gateway $GATEWAY in $RG"
Write-Host "🌐 Runtime URL: $env:AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Read the gateway's runtime key from the gateway, so that it never lands in a file or a deployment log
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = az aigateway api-key list-secrets --ids "$GATEWAY_ID/apiKeys/app-first-call" `
  --query primaryKey --output tsv
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"

# Print the endpoint of the learn MCP server, which MCP clients call
Write-Host "🌐 MCP endpoint: $(azd env get-value MCP_ENDPOINT)"
```

> **Checkpoint**
> `azd up` ended with `SUCCESS`, and the last line is `🌐 MCP endpoint:` with a URL that ends in
> `/default/toolservers/learn/mcp`. In the portal, **MCP servers** lists `learn` with one backend, `learn`.

<!-- /tracks -->

## Federate a second backend

Federation pays off when one endpoint combines several backends. To see it without extra credentials, add the
same public Learn server again under a second namespace, `docs`. Both backends expose a tool called
`microsoft_docs_search`, and the namespaces keep them apart. Mark the new backend as **not required**: if an
optional backend is unavailable, the gateway skips it instead of failing the whole MCP server.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Add the backend

On the `learn` details page, select **Edit**, then go to **Backends**. Select **Add backend** › **MCP server**
and set **URL** to `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`, **Namespace** to `docs`, and **Authentication** to
**None**. In the backends table, turn **Required** off for the new row. Select **Save**.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Add the source

`az aigateway mcp source add` appends one backend and changes only the list of backends. Other settings, such as
the description and policies, stay as they are.

```bash title="Bash"
# Add the Learn MCP server again as an optional backend, under the namespace docs, and list the backends
az aigateway mcp source add -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n learn \
  --namespace docs --kind mcp --required false \
  --mcp '{"transport": "streamableHttp", "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp"}' \
  --query "[].{namespace:namespace,required:required,url:mcp.url}" -o table &&
  echo "🔌 Backend docs is added to learn, as optional"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Write the backend's settings to a file, so that PowerShell passes the JSON to az unchanged
@{ transport = 'streamableHttp'; url = 'https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp' } |
  ConvertTo-Json -Compress | Set-Content -Path mcp.json

# Add the Learn MCP server again as an optional backend, under the namespace docs, and list the backends
az aigateway mcp source add -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n learn `
  --namespace docs --kind mcp --required false --mcp "@mcp.json" `
  --query "[].{namespace:namespace,required:required,url:mcp.url}" -o table
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔌 Backend docs is added to learn, as optional" }
Remove-Item mcp.json
```

The table lists every backend of the server. The command fails with "A source with namespace 'docs' already
exists on this MCP server registration." if you run it twice. For a backend that needs a key, pass the key with
`--credentials`.

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Add the second namespace

When `secondNamespace` isn't empty, the template adds a second endpoint with `required: false`. Set it in the azd
environment and provision again. Only the MCP server changes.

```bash title="Bash"
# Add the second namespace in the azd environment
azd env set MCP_SECOND_NAMESPACE docs &&
  echo "📝 MCP_SECOND_NAMESPACE is docs"

# Deploy the template again: it adds the optional docs backend to the learn MCP server
azd provision &&
  echo "🔌 MCP server learn now has the optional docs backend"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Add the second namespace in the azd environment
azd env set MCP_SECOND_NAMESPACE docs
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 MCP_SECOND_NAMESPACE is docs" }

# Deploy the template again: it adds the optional docs backend to the learn MCP server
azd provision
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔌 MCP server learn now has the optional docs backend" }
```

<!-- /tracks -->

> [!TIP]
> In production, the second backend is a different service. For an internal REST API, choose **OpenAPI spec**
> and point **Spec source** › **Fetch from URL** at its OpenAPI document. For an API that needs a key, set
> **Authentication** to **API key** with the **Header name** and **Key value** the backend expects. Clients
> never see that key.

> **Checkpoint**
> The `learn` server has two backends: `learn` (required) and `docs` (optional).

## Choose supported MCP versions

MCP is versioned by date. A client opens a connection by naming the protocol version it speaks, and the server
answers with the version both sides will use. AI Gateway negotiates one version for the whole MCP server, so
that version must work with **every backend** behind it.

| Supported MCP versions | What clients get |
|---|---|
| Not configured | The legacy defaults: `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26`, and `2024-11-05`. The portal labels them **Legacy defaults**. |
| A list that you choose | Version restrictions. Clients negotiate only a version in the list, and a request whose `MCP-Protocol-Version` header names any other version is rejected with `400`. |

You can choose `2026-07-28`, `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26`, and `2024-11-05`. Version
`2026-07-28` is the stateless revision of the specification: it replaces the `initialize` handshake and
sessions with a `server/discover` request, and every request carries `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Method`, and
`Mcp-Name` headers plus metadata in `params._meta`. Select it only when every backend supports it, and use an
MCP SDK that implements it rather than hand-written requests.

In this lab, pin the server to `2025-06-18`. At the time of writing, that's the version the Microsoft Learn MCP
server negotiates, so both backends, `learn` and `docs`, support it.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Pin the version

1. On the `learn` details page, find **Supported MCP versions**. Unless you changed it, it lists the legacy
   defaults.
2. Select **Edit**. On **Basic info**, open **Supported MCP versions** and keep only `2025-06-18` selected.
3. Go to **Backends**. Because the list changed, the portal asks you to recheck the backends: "Supported MCP
   versions changed. Edit and save each external MCP backend before saving this server." For each backend row,
   select **Edit**, then **Save** in **Edit MCP backend**. The portal checks which versions the backend
   supports before it saves the row.
4. Select **Save**.

If a backend doesn't support a selected version, **Edit MCP backend** shows "Backend isn't compatible with all
configured MCP versions." and lists the versions the backend reports. Return to **Basic info** and change the
list, or update the backend.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Set the versions

The `aigateway` extension doesn't set MCP protocol versions yet, so call the Azure Resource Manager REST API with
`az rest`. A `PATCH` that sends only `properties.versions` keeps the backends, tool rules, and policies as they are.

```bash title="Bash"
# Pin learn to MCP version 2025-06-18 with a PATCH that changes only properties.versions
az rest --method patch --url "$WS/toolServers/learn?$API" \
  --body '{"properties": {"versions": ["2025-06-18"]}}' --query properties.versions &&
  echo "📝 MCP server learn supports only MCP version 2025-06-18"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Write the request body to a file, so that PowerShell passes the JSON to az unchanged
@{ properties = @{ versions = @('2025-06-18') } } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 -Compress | Set-Content -Path body.json

# Pin learn to MCP version 2025-06-18 with a PATCH that changes only properties.versions
az rest --method patch --url "$WS/toolServers/learn?$API" --body '@body.json' --query properties.versions
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 MCP server learn supports only MCP version 2025-06-18" }
Remove-Item body.json
```

Unlike the portal, the API doesn't ask the backends which versions they support. If you list a version that a
backend can't speak, the `PATCH` succeeds and clients that negotiate that version fail. See
[Troubleshooting](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md#lab-04-federate-mcp-tools).

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Pin the versions

The `supportedVersions` parameter takes a comma-separated list, such as `2025-06-18` or `2026-07-28,2025-06-18`,
and azd fills it from `MCP_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS`. Set it and provision again. The azd environment keeps
`MCP_SECOND_NAMESPACE`, so both backends stay.

```bash title="Bash"
# Pin learn to MCP version 2025-06-18 in the azd environment
azd env set MCP_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS 2025-06-18 &&
  echo "📝 MCP_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS is 2025-06-18"

# Deploy the template again: it sets the supported versions of the learn MCP server
azd provision &&
  echo "🚀 MCP server learn is deployed with MCP version 2025-06-18"

# Show the versions that learn supports now
echo "📝 Supported MCP versions of learn:"
az aigateway mcp show -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n learn --query properties.versions
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Pin learn to MCP version 2025-06-18 in the azd environment
azd env set MCP_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS 2025-06-18
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 MCP_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS is 2025-06-18" }

# Deploy the template again: it sets the supported versions of the learn MCP server
azd provision
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚀 MCP server learn is deployed with MCP version 2025-06-18" }

# Show the versions that learn supports now
Write-Host "📝 Supported MCP versions of learn:"
az aigateway mcp show -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n learn --query properties.versions
```

The last command prints a list that holds only `2025-06-18`. An empty value doesn't clear a list that the server already has, so
to change the versions later, set another list.

<!-- /tracks -->

### Check the negotiated version

Ask for an older version. The gateway answers with the version it will use:

```bash title="Bash"
# Send an initialize request that asks for 2025-03-26, with your runtime key in api-key
echo "🔌 initialize response from learn:"
curl -sS "${AI_GATEWAY_URL%/}/default/toolservers/learn/mcp" \
  -H "api-key: $AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26",
       "capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"1.0"}}}'
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Build an initialize request that asks for 2025-03-26, with your runtime key in api-key
$mcp     = "$($env:AI_GATEWAY_URL.TrimEnd('/'))/default/toolservers/learn/mcp"
$headers = @{ 'api-key' = $env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY; Accept = 'application/json, text/event-stream' }
$body    = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26",
             "capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"pwsh","version":"1.0"}}}'

# Send it, and print the response, with the version that the gateway chose
Write-Host "🔌 initialize response from learn:"
(Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -Uri $mcp -Headers $headers -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body).Content
```

The result includes `"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18"`. Now send a request that names a version outside the list:

```bash title="Bash"

The gateway rejects it with `🚦 HTTP 400` and `Unsupported MCP-Protocol-Version` before any backend is called.

> **Supported MCP versions** shows `2025-06-18` on the details page and in **Catalog**, an `initialize` request
> for `2025-03-26` returns `2025-06-18`, and a `2026-07-28` request is rejected with `400`.

## Connect a client

Any MCP-compatible client or agent framework can use the endpoint. Store the runtime key in the client's
secret store, never in a file that you commit.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Use the Connect panel

On the `learn` details page, select **Connect**. The panel offers **VS Code** and **Cursor** (install through a
deep link) and **mcp.json** (raw configuration for any MCP-aware client). Replace any key placeholder with your
runtime key in the client's secret prompt, not in a committed file.

<!-- track: code | Code -->

### Add the server to VS Code

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in a project, paste this configuration, and replace `<gateway>` with your gateway
name. The `inputs` entry makes VS Code prompt for the key instead of storing it in the file.

<!-- include: infra/mcp.json -->

On GitHub, open [infra/mcp.json](infra/mcp.json).

Start the `ai-gateway-learn` server from the `mcp.json` editor and paste your runtime key when prompted. In
Copilot Chat agent mode, the gateway's namespaced tools are now available, for example
`learn_microsoft_docs_search`.

### Call the tools from Python

This client uses the official [MCP Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/) and sends the runtime key in the
`api-key` header.

<!-- include: infra/list_tools.py -->

On GitHub, open [infra/list_tools.py](infra/list_tools.py).

```bash title="Bash"
# Create a virtual environment in .venv and activate it, so that the packages stay out of your global Python
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate &&
  echo "📦 Virtual environment .venv is active"

# Install the MCP Python SDK and httpx, which the script uses
pip install -r infra/requirements.txt &&
  echo "📦 The packages in infra/requirements.txt are installed"

# List the tools on learn through your gateway, then call learn_microsoft_docs_search
echo "🔧 Tools on learn, and a call to learn_microsoft_docs_search:"
python infra/list_tools.py learn learn_microsoft_docs_search "How do I add a token limit in AI Gateway?"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Create a virtual environment in .venv and activate it, so that the packages stay out of your global Python
python -m venv .venv; .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
if ($?) { Write-Host "📦 Virtual environment .venv is active" }

# Install the MCP Python SDK and httpx, which the script uses
pip install -r infra/requirements.txt
if ($?) { Write-Host "📦 The packages in infra/requirements.txt are installed" }

# List the tools on learn through your gateway, then call learn_microsoft_docs_search
Write-Host "🔧 Tools on learn, and a call to learn_microsoft_docs_search:"
python infra/list_tools.py learn learn_microsoft_docs_search "How do I add a token limit in AI Gateway?"
```

<!-- /tracks -->

## Verify

<!-- steps -->

### List the published tools

MCP clients start with a handshake: `initialize`, then `notifications/initialized`, then `tools/list`. The
script runs that handshake through your gateway, reads JSON or server-sent event (SSE) responses, and prints
every published tool. Run it from the lab folder.

```bash title="Bash"
# Run the MCP handshake through your gateway, and list every tool that learn publishes
echo "🔧 Tools on learn:"
./infra/list-tools.sh learn
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Run the MCP handshake through your gateway, and list every tool that learn publishes
Write-Host "🔧 Tools on learn:"
./infra/list-tools.ps1 -Server learn
```

On GitHub, open [list-tools.sh](infra/list-tools.sh) or [list-tools.ps1](infra/list-tools.ps1).

Expected output (descriptions are shortened, and the tool list can change as the Learn server evolves):

```text
🔧 Tools on learn:
MCP endpoint: https://<gateway>.eastus2-01.ai.gateway.azure.com/default/toolservers/learn/mcp
Server: <server-name-reported-by-the-gateway>  protocol: <negotiated-version>

Tool                                          Description
learn_microsoft_docs_search                   Search official Microsoft/Azure documentation to find the most relevan
learn_microsoft_code_sample_search            Search for code snippets and examples in official Microsoft Learn docu
learn_microsoft_docs_fetch                    Fetch and convert a Microsoft Learn documentation webpage to markdown
docs_microsoft_docs_search                    Search official Microsoft/Azure documentation to find the most relevan
docs_microsoft_code_sample_search             Search for code snippets and examples in official Microsoft Learn docu
docs_microsoft_docs_fetch                     Fetch and convert a Microsoft Learn documentation webpage to markdown

6 tools published
```

Each tool carries its backend's namespace. Use the exact names that your output shows in the next steps.

### Call a tool through the gateway

```bash title="Bash"
# List the tools again, then call learn_microsoft_docs_search with a question
echo "🔧 Tools on learn, and a call to learn_microsoft_docs_search:"
./infra/list-tools.sh learn learn_microsoft_docs_search "How do I add a token limit in AI Gateway?"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# List the tools again, then call learn_microsoft_docs_search with a question
Write-Host "🔧 Tools on learn, and a call to learn_microsoft_docs_search:"
./infra/list-tools.ps1 -Server learn -Tool learn_microsoft_docs_search -Query "How do I add a token limit in AI Gateway?"
```

After the tool list, the script prints the start of the search results that Microsoft Learn returned through
your gateway.

### Send a raw JSON-RPC request

The docs show the smallest possible request: a single JSON-RPC `tools/list` call. Streamable HTTP clients
should also accept both JSON and SSE responses.

```bash
# Send a single tools/list request, with your runtime key in api-key
echo "🔧 tools/list response from learn:"
curl -sS "${AI_GATEWAY_URL%/}/default/toolservers/learn/mcp" \
  -H "api-key: $AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

The answer is JSON or an SSE `data:` line with a `result.tools` array. If the server answers with a JSON-RPC
`error` instead, it requires the full handshake. Use the script, which runs it for you.

### Prove that the gateway checks the caller

Send the same request without the key:

```bash
# Send the same request without the api-key header
echo "🚦 Expect 401 Unauthorized without a key:"
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "🚦 HTTP %{http_code}\n" "${AI_GATEWAY_URL%/}/default/toolservers/learn/mcp" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

The gateway rejects the request, typically with `🚦 HTTP 401`, and no backend is called. Microsoft Learn is public,
but your MCP endpoint isn't.

<!-- /steps -->

> **Checkpoint**
> The script lists namespaced tools from both backends, a tool call returns Microsoft Learn content, and a
> request without a key is rejected.

## Go further

- **Control the catalog.** Publish only approved tools, block risky ones, and rate-limit the server in
  [Control which tools agents can call](../05-mcp-tool-controls/README.md).
- **Screen tool traffic.** Content safety also screens tool inputs and responses on MCP servers. See
  [Screen prompts and responses with content safety](../08-content-safety/README.md).
- **Go keyless.** Grant callers the **AI Gateway User** role and send a Microsoft Entra token instead of a
  runtime key. See [Go keyless with Microsoft Entra ID and RBAC](../11-entra-rbac/README.md).
- **Watch tool traffic.** When Application Insights is configured, tool executions appear in **Monitoring** ›
  **Tools**. See [Monitor usage, cost, and traces](../13-monitoring/README.md).
- **Onboard GitHub.** Add the GitHub MCP server, `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`, as an **MCP server**
  backend with **API key** authentication: **Header name** `Authorization` and **Key value**
  `Bearer <your-github-token>`. The gateway stores the token, and clients never see it.
- **Give tools to an agent.** Point an agent framework at the endpoint in [Connect agent frameworks to models and tools](../15-agent-frameworks/README.md).

## Clean up

MCP servers don't add charges beyond the gateway itself. Keep `learn` if you continue with
[Control which tools agents can call](../05-mcp-tool-controls/README.md), which builds on it.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Remove the second backend or the server

To remove only the `docs` backend, select **Edit** on the `learn` details page, delete its row on **Backends**,
and select **Save**. To remove the whole server, select **Delete** on the details page.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Remove the second source or the server

```bash title="Bash"
# Remove only the optional backend
az aigateway mcp source remove -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n learn --namespace docs --query "[].namespace" &&
  echo "🚮 Backend docs is removed from learn"

# Or remove the whole MCP server
az aigateway mcp delete -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n learn --yes &&
  echo "🚮 MCP server learn is deleted"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Remove only the optional backend
az aigateway mcp source remove -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n learn --namespace docs --query "[].namespace"
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚮 Backend docs is removed from learn" }

# Or remove the whole MCP server
az aigateway mcp delete -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n learn --yes
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚮 MCP server learn is deleted" }
```

`mcp source remove` prints the backends that remain. An MCP server needs at least one backend, so the command
refuses to remove the last one with "Cannot remove the last source." Delete the server instead.

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Delete everything azd created

In the `ai-gateway/labs/04-federate-mcp-tools` folder, delete the resource group with the gateway, the `learn` MCP
server, and the key. [`--purge`](../SETUP.md#delete-what-azd-created) also purges soft-deleted resources. It takes
about ten minutes.

```bash
# Delete the resource group with everything that azd up created, and purge soft-deleted resources
azd down --purge --force &&
  echo "🚮 Everything that azd up created is deleted"
```

To keep this gateway instead, skip `azd down`. To go back to one backend, run
`azd env set MCP_SECOND_NAMESPACE ""`, then `azd provision`.

<!-- track: code | Code -->

### Remove the client configuration

Delete the `ai-gateway-learn` entry from `.vscode/mcp.json` and the `.venv` folder you created.

<!-- /tracks -->

Keep your gateway from lab 01: the next labs reuse it. `azd down` doesn't touch it, because the Bicep + azd track
created its own gateway.
