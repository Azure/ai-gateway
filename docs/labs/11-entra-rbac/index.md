# Go keyless with Microsoft Entra ID and RBAC

A security review of your AI platform found runtime API keys in `.env` files, CI logs, and a shared notebook.
Every key grants every model and tool on the gateway, nobody can say which person is behind a key, and
rotation means chasing every team. The platform team wants callers to use **their own Microsoft Entra
identity** instead: access granted by Azure RBAC, scoped to one model alias or MCP server when needed, and
removed automatically when someone leaves a group. In this lab you grant a data-plane role, call a model with
an Entra token from the playground, the command line, and code, and see what the gateway answers when the role
is missing.

![Callers authenticate inbound to the gateway, and the gateway authenticates outbound to each backend](../assets/diagrams/identity-boundaries.svg "Inbound, callers present a Microsoft Entra token and Azure RBAC decides which models and tools they can use. Outbound, the gateway uses its own identity, which you configure in lab 12.")

<!-- widget: request-lifecycle -->

## Before you begin

> [!TIP]
> On the **Bicep + azd** track, `azd up` creates its own gateway and model and grants you the role, so you can skip
> this section. You need only [Cloud Shell or the azd tools](../SETUP.md#choose-where-to-run-commands).

- Complete [Publish a Foundry model and make your first call](../02-first-model-call/README.md). You need a gateway with at least
  one model alias.
- The Azure CLI with the [`aigateway` extension](../SETUP.md#install-the-aigateway-extension),
  [signed in](../SETUP.md#sign-in-to-azure) to the tenant that holds the gateway.
- For the CLI track in Bash: [jq](https://jqlang.org/download/), which decodes the token and reads the reply.
- Permission to **create role assignments** on the gateway: **Owner**, **User Access Administrator**, or
  **Role Based Access Control Administrator**. **Contributor** can manage the gateway but can't grant roles.
  If you don't have one of these, ask an administrator to run the role assignment step for you.
- For the Code track, one of: Python 3.9 or later, Node.js 22.18 or later, or the .NET 8 SDK or later.
- For the scripts and samples: the labs repo, [cloned](../SETUP.md#clone-the-labs-repo). Run them from the lab
  folder, `~/ai-gateway/labs/11-entra-rbac`.

You don't need an API key in this lab. Set these variables once. Every track and the **Verify** section reuse
them.

## How it works

Access to AI Gateway crosses two trust boundaries. **Inbound**, your app authenticates to the gateway
endpoint. **Outbound**, the gateway authenticates to each model or tool with its own credential, which you
set up in [Call backends with managed identities](../12-backend-identity/README.md).

For inbound Entra access, the caller gets an access token for the audience `https://azure-api.net/aigateway`
and sends it in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The gateway validates the token at its edge, then
checks the caller's Azure RBAC role assignments for the model alias or MCP server in the request. Without a
matching role, it answers `403` before any policy or backend runs. These roles grant **runtime** access only,
not gateway administration.

| Role | Role ID | Grants | Assignable at |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Gateway User | `caad7a21-134e-43f4-a550-c5ffc17e051c` | List and invoke models, list and call MCP tools | Gateway, model alias, or MCP server |
| AI Gateway Models User | `a6b68e3d-a1f0-4c60-8678-237c050cf4ea` | List and invoke models | Gateway or model alias |
| AI Gateway Tools User | `dce03f8d-857f-4e40-a90d-67770fa6ecd2` | List and call tools within MCP servers | Gateway or MCP server |

| Caller | Token type | Scope to request |
|---|---|---|
| App that signs users in with MSAL | Delegated (on behalf of the user) | `https://azure-api.net/aigateway/Data.All` |
| Service principal, managed identity, or agent identity | App-only | `https://azure-api.net/aigateway/.default` |
| You, signed in to the Azure CLI | Delegated | `az account get-access-token --resource https://azure-api.net/aigateway` |

Policies that count by **Caller identity**, such as the token limits and budgets in labs 06 and 07, keep
working: for Entra callers, the gateway combines the token's tenant ID (`tid`) and object ID (`oid`), so each
principal gets its own counter.

## Grant a data-plane role

Grant yourself **AI Gateway Models User** on the whole gateway. Do this once, whichever track you follow to
call the gateway afterward. Role scopes are Azure resource IDs:

| Scope | Resource ID |
|---|---|
| Gateway | `/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways/<gateway>` |
| Model alias | `<gateway resource ID>/workspaces/default/aliases/<alias>` |
| MCP server | `<gateway resource ID>/workspaces/default/toolServers/<mcp-server-name>` |

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Start a role assignment

Open the [AI Gateway portal](https://ai.gateway.azure.com), select your gateway, and select
**Access** › **Entra ID** › **Add role assignments**.

### Choose access

On **Choose access**, pick what the identities can use:

- **All models and tools in the gateway** grants **AI Gateway User** at the gateway.
- **All models in the gateway** grants **AI Gateway Models User** at the gateway.
- **All tools in the gateway** grants **AI Gateway Tools User** at the gateway.
- **Specific resources** lets you select model aliases and MCP servers under **Resources**, then choose one
  compatible **Role** for all of them.

Select **All models in the gateway**, then **Next**.

![The Add role assignments wizard on the Choose access step](../assets/screens/access-entra-role-assignments.png "Choose gateway-wide access, or select specific model aliases and MCP servers and apply one compatible role.")

### Select identities

On **Select identities**, set **Assign access to** to **User, group, or service principal**, search for your
own account by name, and choose **Select**. In production, prefer an Entra group so membership controls
access. To grant an app running in Azure, set **Assign access to** to **Managed identity** and pick it by
subscription and resource type. You can also enter a principal object ID directly. Select **Next**.

### Review and assign

On **Review + assign**, confirm the role, identities, and scopes, then select **Assign**.

> **Checkpoint**
> Your account appears in **Access** › **Entra ID** with the **AI Gateway Models User** role on the gateway.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Create the role assignment

`az role assignment create` needs the principal's object ID, the role ID, and the full scope:

```bash title="Bash"
# Give yourself the AI Gateway Models User role (a6b68e3d-…) on the whole gateway, so that you can call its models
az role assignment create \
  --assignee-object-id "$MY_OBJECT_ID" \
  --assignee-principal-type User \
  --role "a6b68e3d-a1f0-4c60-8678-237c050cf4ea" \
  --scope "$GATEWAY_ID" --output none &&
  echo "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Models User role on $GATEWAY"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Give yourself the AI Gateway Models User role (a6b68e3d-…) on the whole gateway, so that you can call its models
az role assignment create `
  --assignee-object-id $MY_OBJECT_ID `
  --assignee-principal-type User `
  --role "a6b68e3d-a1f0-4c60-8678-237c050cf4ea" `
  --scope $GATEWAY_ID --output none
if ($?) { Write-Host "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Models User role on $GATEWAY" }
```

### Use the helper for other roles and scopes

The lab's helper script maps `user`, `models`, and `tools` to the role IDs, builds the scope for the gateway,
a model alias, or an MCP server, and defaults to the signed-in user:

```bash title="Bash"
# Give yourself the AI Gateway Models User role on the whole gateway
./infra/assign-roles.sh models &&
  echo "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Models User role on $GATEWAY"

# Or grant the same role on one model alias only, so that calls to other aliases return 403
./infra/assign-roles.sh models "alias:$AI_GATEWAY_MODEL" &&
  echo "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Models User role on the alias $AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"

# Or grant AI Gateway Tools User on one MCP server, which lets you list and call its tools, but not models
./infra/assign-roles.sh tools "mcp:<mcp-server-name>" &&
  echo "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Tools User role on the MCP server"

# Or give an Entra group AI Gateway User (models and tools) on the gateway, so that membership controls access
./infra/assign-roles.sh user gateway <group-object-id> Group &&
  echo "🛡️ The group has the AI Gateway User role on $GATEWAY"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Give yourself the AI Gateway Models User role on the whole gateway
./infra/assign-roles.ps1 -Role models
if ($?) { Write-Host "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Models User role on $GATEWAY" }

# Or grant the same role on one model alias only, so that calls to other aliases return 403
./infra/assign-roles.ps1 -Role models -Scope "alias:$env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"
if ($?) { Write-Host "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Models User role on the alias $env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL" }

# Or grant AI Gateway Tools User on one MCP server, which lets you list and call its tools, but not models
./infra/assign-roles.ps1 -Role tools -Scope "mcp:<mcp-server-name>"
if ($?) { Write-Host "🛡️ You have the AI Gateway Tools User role on the MCP server" }

# Or give an Entra group AI Gateway User (models and tools) on the gateway, so that membership controls access
./infra/assign-roles.ps1 -Role user -PrincipalId <group-object-id> -PrincipalType Group
if ($?) { Write-Host "🛡️ The group has the AI Gateway User role on $GATEWAY" }
```

<!-- include: infra/assign-roles.sh -->

On GitHub, open [assign-roles.sh](infra/assign-roles.sh) or [assign-roles.ps1](infra/assign-roles.ps1).

For a managed identity, pass its **principal** (object) ID with the type `ServicePrincipal`, for example
from `az identity show -g <resource-group> -n <identity-name> --query principalId -o tsv`.

### Confirm the assignment

```bash title="Bash"
# List your role assignments on the gateway, with each role's name and scope
echo "🛡️ Your role assignments on $GATEWAY:"
az role assignment list --scope "$GATEWAY_ID" \
  --query "[?principalId=='$MY_OBJECT_ID'].{Role:roleDefinitionName, Scope:scope}" -o table
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# List your role assignments on the gateway, with each role's name and scope
Write-Host "🛡️ Your role assignments on ${GATEWAY}:"
az role assignment list --scope $GATEWAY_ID `
  --query "[?principalId=='$MY_OBJECT_ID'].{Role:roleDefinitionName, Scope:scope}" -o table
```

> **Checkpoint**
> The list shows **AI Gateway Models User** with the gateway's resource ID as the scope.

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

**What you need:** [Cloud Shell or the azd tools](../SETUP.md#choose-where-to-run-commands) with the
[`aigateway` extension](../SETUP.md#install-the-aigateway-extension), [signed in](../SETUP.md#sign-in-to-azure). This
track doesn't use your gateway from lab 02: `azd up` creates a new one, so it works on its own.

### Choose what to declare

The template grants one AI Gateway role to one principal at the gateway, a model alias, or an MCP server. It
names the assignment with `guid()` of the scope, principal, and role, so redeploying it changes nothing. azd
passes your signed-in identity as the principal: it sets `AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID` to your object ID before every
deployment.

### Clone the lab

The lab is a small azd project in the
[`labs/11-entra-rbac`](https://github.com/Azure/ai-gateway/tree/main/labs/11-entra-rbac) folder.
[Clone the labs repo](../SETUP.md#clone-the-labs-repo) if you haven't yet, then move into the lab's folder.

```bash title="Bash or PowerShell"
# Move into the lab's folder, which holds the azd project
cd ~/ai-gateway/labs/11-entra-rbac &&
  echo "📂 Lab folder: ~/ai-gateway/labs/11-entra-rbac"
```

### Review the templates

`infra/main.bicep` creates the resource group `rg-<environment name>` and calls the quick start's
[resources.bicep](../quickstart/infra/resources.bicep) for the gateway, the Foundry model, its default alias, and the
`app-first-call` key, which this lab doesn't use. Then it calls `infra/role-assignment.bicep` with your object ID:

<!-- include: infra/main.bicep -->

`infra/role-assignment.bicep` creates the assignment. It only references the gateway, so you can also deploy it
on its own to your gateway from lab 02, with `az deployment group create -g <resource-group> --template-file
infra/role-assignment.bicep --parameters gatewayName=<gateway> principalId=<object-id>`:

<!-- include: infra/role-assignment.bicep -->

For a group or managed identity, pass its object ID with `principalType=Group` or `principalType=ServicePrincipal`.
If you already hold the role at the same scope, that deployment fails with `RoleAssignmentExists`, because the
existing assignment has a different name. You have the access you need, so carry on.

### Deploy with azd up

Create an azd environment named `aigw-lab11` in your current subscription, then provision everything. It takes
about three minutes.

```bash title="Bash"
# Create an azd environment in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab11 --location eastus2 --subscription "$(az account show --query id --output tsv)" &&
  echo "📝 azd environment aigw-lab11 deploys to eastus2"

# Provision the gateway, the Foundry model and its alias, and your AI Gateway data-plane role on the gateway
azd up &&
  echo "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Create an azd environment in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab11 --location eastus2 --subscription (az account show --query id --output tsv)
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 azd environment aigw-lab11 deploys to eastus2" }

# Provision the gateway, the Foundry model and its alias, and your AI Gateway data-plane role on the gateway
azd up
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)" }
```

For another region, pick one where AI Gateway and the `gpt-6-luna` model are available, as in [Find the available
regions](../SETUP.md#find-the-available-regions).

### Read the outputs

Set the variables that the next sections and **Verify** use from azd's environment values. This lab is keyless, so
you don't read the key. The last command lists your role assignments on the gateway.

```bash title="Bash"
# Read the gateway's names, resource ID, runtime URL, and alias from azd's environment values
export RG="$(azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)"
export GATEWAY="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_NAME)"

export MODEL="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_BACKEND_MODEL)"
export GATEWAY_ID="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_ID)"

echo "🔑 AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY is unset, so every call in this lab is keyless"

# List your role assignments on the gateway, including the one that azd up created
echo "🛡️ Your role assignments on $GATEWAY:"
az role assignment list --scope "$GATEWAY_ID" \
  --query "[?principalId=='$MY_OBJECT_ID'].{Role:roleDefinitionName, Scope:scope}" -o table
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"

Write-Host "🔑 AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY is removed, so every call in this lab is keyless"

# List your role assignments on the gateway, including the one that azd up created
Write-Host "🛡️ Your role assignments on ${GATEWAY}:"
az role assignment list --scope $GATEWAY_ID `
  --query "[?principalId=='$MY_OBJECT_ID'].{Role:roleDefinitionName, Scope:scope}" -o table
```

> **Checkpoint**
> `azd up` ended with `SUCCESS`, and the list shows **AI Gateway Models User** with the gateway's resource ID as
> the scope. In the portal, **Access** › **Entra ID** lists you with that role.

### Change the role or the scope

The parameters come from azd environment values, with the defaults in `infra/main.parameters.json`.
`DATA_PLANE_ROLE` picks the role (`user`, `models`, or `tools`), and `DATA_PLANE_ROLE_SCOPE` picks where to grant
it (`gateway`, or `alias` for the default alias only). To grant only the alias, set the scope and provision again:

```bash title="Bash"
# Grant the role on the default alias instead of the whole gateway
azd env set DATA_PLANE_ROLE_SCOPE alias &&
  echo "📝 DATA_PLANE_ROLE_SCOPE is alias"

# Deploy the templates again, which adds the role assignment on the alias
azd provision &&
  echo "🛡️ You also have the role on the alias $AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Grant the role on the default alias instead of the whole gateway
azd env set DATA_PLANE_ROLE_SCOPE alias
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 DATA_PLANE_ROLE_SCOPE is alias" }

# Deploy the templates again, which adds the role assignment on the alias
azd provision
if ($?) { Write-Host "🛡️ You also have the role on the alias $env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL" }
```

A Bicep deployment only adds or updates resources, so you now hold the role on the gateway **and** on the alias.
To test the narrower scope, remove the gateway-wide assignment with the command in **Remove the role and try
again** under **Verify**: calls to the alias still return `200`. Set `DATA_PLANE_ROLE_SCOPE` back to `gateway` and
run `azd provision` before **Verify**, which re-creates the gateway-wide assignment. For an MCP server, deploy
`infra/role-assignment.bicep` on its own with `role=tools scope=mcp scopeName=<mcp-server-name>`.

<!-- /tracks -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Role assignments can take several minutes to apply. Until then, Entra calls return `403`. Wait a few
> minutes and retry before you change anything else.

## Call the gateway with a token

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Open the playground with Entra ID

Select **Catalog** and pick your model. In the playground toolbar, the **Authentication** list has a
**Token** group with **Microsoft Entra ID** ("Use your signed-in identity.") and an **API key** group with
your runtime keys. When your role allows invoking the model, the portal selects **Microsoft Entra ID** for you.
It checks your permissions through the control plane, so you also need `Microsoft.Authorization/permissions/read`
on the gateway, which **Reader** and higher roles include.

If **Microsoft Entra ID** is disabled, the tooltip tells you to grant access under **Access** › **Entra ID**.
Wait for the role to apply and refresh the page.

### Send a prompt

With **Microsoft Entra ID** selected, send `In one sentence, why use Microsoft Entra ID instead of API keys?`.
The playground's code examples follow the authentication method you select.

> **Checkpoint**
> The model answers, and the **Authentication** list shows **Microsoft Entra ID**, not a key name.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Get a token

The Azure CLI can issue a token for the AI Gateway audience with your sign-in:

```bash title="Bash"
# Get an access token for the AI Gateway audience, with your Azure CLI sign-in
export AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN="$(az account get-access-token \
  --resource https://azure-api.net/aigateway --query accessToken -o tsv)"
echo "🪪 Token acquired: in AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN (${#AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Get an access token for the AI Gateway audience, with your Azure CLI sign-in
$env:AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN = az account get-access-token `
  --resource https://azure-api.net/aigateway --query accessToken -o tsv
Write-Host "🪪 Token acquired: in AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

Access tokens are short-lived, typically about an hour. Run the command again when you get a `401`.

### Look inside the token

Decode the token's payload (the middle segment) to see what the gateway checks:

```bash title="Bash"
# Decode the token's payload, its middle segment, and show the claims that the gateway checks
echo "🪪 Token claims:"
jq -R 'split(".")[1] | gsub("-";"+") | gsub("_";"/") | @base64d | fromjson
  | {aud, tid, oid, scp, appid}' <<< "$AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Take the token's payload, its middle segment, and turn its base64url text into padded base64
$payload = ($env:AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN -split '\.')[1].Replace('-', '+').Replace('_', '/')
$payload = $payload.PadRight($payload.Length + (4 - $payload.Length % 4) % 4, '=')

# Decode the payload, and show the claims that the gateway checks
Write-Host "🪪 Token claims:"
[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($payload)) |
  ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object aud, tid, oid, scp, appid
```

`aud` is `https://azure-api.net/aigateway`, `scp` includes `Data.All` because the CLI gets a delegated token
for you, and `tid` plus `oid` identify you to per-caller policies.

### Call the model with the bearer token

```bash title="Bash"
# Call the model with your token in the Authorization header, and no api-key header
curl -sS "${AI_GATEWAY_URL%/}/default/models/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$AI_GATEWAY_MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Say hello in five words.\"}]}" \
  | jq -r 'if .choices then "🤖 \(.choices[0].message.content)" else "⚠️ \(.error.message // .)" end'
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Build the request: the alias in model, and one user message
$body = @{
  model    = $env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL
  messages = @(@{ role = "user"; content = "Say hello in five words." })
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5

### Install the packages

Each sample uses `DefaultAzureCredential`, which uses your Azure CLI or IDE sign-in on a laptop and a managed
identity or workload identity when the code runs in Azure. No key or secret appears in code or config.

```bash title="Python"
# Move into the folder that holds the samples
cd infra
echo "📂 Sample folder: infra"

# Create a virtual environment for the packages, and activate it
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
echo "🧩 The virtual environment .venv is active"

# Install the OpenAI and Azure Identity packages that the sample uses
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "🧩 The OpenAI and Azure Identity packages are installed"
```

```bash title="TypeScript"
# Move into the folder that holds the samples
cd infra
echo "📂 Sample folder: infra"

# Install the OpenAI and Azure Identity packages that the sample uses
npm install
echo "🧩 The OpenAI and Azure Identity packages are installed"
```

```bash title="C#"
# Move into the folder that holds the samples
cd infra
echo "📂 Sample folder: infra"

# Restore the Azure Identity package that the sample uses
dotnet restore
echo "🧩 The Azure Identity package is restored"
```

### Review the sample

The only change from an API-key client is where the credential comes from:

```python title="Python"
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
from openai import OpenAI

token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://azure-api.net/aigateway/.default")

client = OpenAI(
    base_url=f"{gateway_url}/default/models/openai/v1",
    api_key=token_provider,   # called before each request, sent as Authorization: Bearer <token>
)
```

```typescript title="TypeScript"
import { DefaultAzureCredential, getBearerTokenProvider } from "@azure/identity";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const getToken = getBearerTokenProvider(
  new DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://azure-api.net/aigateway/.default");

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: `${gatewayUrl}/default/models/openai/v1`,
  apiKey: getToken,   // called before each request, sent as Authorization: Bearer <token>
});
```

```csharp title="C#"
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
AccessToken token = await credential.GetTokenAsync(
    new TokenRequestContext(new[] { "https://azure-api.net/aigateway/.default" }));

request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token.Token);
```

The OpenAI SDKs for Python (1.106 or later) and TypeScript (5.18 or later) accept a function as the API key.
They call it before each request and send the result as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and the Azure
Identity token provider refreshes the token before it expires. The C# sample calls the REST endpoint with
`HttpClient` and asks the credential for a token before each call, which also returns a cached token until
it's close to expiry. Don't use an `AzureOpenAI` client here: the gateway exposes the OpenAI v1 API at
`/default/models/openai/v1`.

The complete samples add input checks and print the reply and token usage:

<!-- include: infra/call_with_entra.py -->

<!-- include: infra/call-with-entra.ts -->

<!-- include: infra/CallWithEntra.cs -->

On GitHub, open [call_with_entra.py](infra/call_with_entra.py), [call-with-entra.ts](infra/call-with-entra.ts),
and [CallWithEntra.cs](infra/CallWithEntra.cs) with [CallWithEntra.csproj](infra/CallWithEntra.csproj).

### Run it

```bash title="Python"
# Run the sample, which calls the model with an Entra ID token and prints the reply and the tokens used
echo "🤖 Calling the model with your Entra ID token, and no API key:"
python call_with_entra.py
```

```bash title="TypeScript"
# Run the sample, which calls the model with an Entra ID token and prints the reply and the tokens used
echo "🤖 Calling the model with your Entra ID token, and no API key:"
node call-with-entra.ts
```

```bash title="C#"
# Build and run the sample, which calls the model with an Entra ID token and prints the reply and the tokens used
echo "🤖 Calling the model with your Entra ID token, and no API key:"
dotnet run
```

> **Checkpoint**
> The sample prints the model's reply and the tokens used, with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` unset.

<!-- /tracks -->

## Verify

Prove that access now follows the role assignment, not a key.

<!-- steps -->

### Confirm the keyless call succeeds

Run the curl call or a code sample from the previous section. It returns `200` with a reply.

### Send a token for the wrong audience

A token for Azure Resource Manager is valid, but not for AI Gateway:

```bash
# Call the model with a token for Azure Resource Manager, the CLI's default audience, and print the status code
echo "🚦 Expect 401 Unauthorized, because the token is for the wrong audience:"
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "${AI_GATEWAY_URL%/}/default/models/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(az account get-access-token --query accessToken -o tsv)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$AI_GATEWAY_MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"ping\"}]}"
```

The gateway answers `401`: authentication failed, so the role was never checked.

### Remove the role and try again

Remove your assignment, wait a few minutes, get a fresh token, and repeat the curl call:

```bash
# Delete your AI Gateway Models User role assignment (a6b68e3d-…) on the gateway
az role assignment delete --assignee "$MY_OBJECT_ID" \
  --role "a6b68e3d-a1f0-4c60-8678-237c050cf4ea" --scope "$GATEWAY_ID" &&
  echo "🧹 Your AI Gateway Models User role assignment on $GATEWAY is deleted"
```

The gateway now answers `403`: you're authenticated, but no role allows you to invoke the model. In the
playground, the same error offers **Review access**, which opens the role assignments, and
**Copy access request**, which copies your identity, the suggested role, and the scope for an administrator.

### Restore access

Assign the role again (portal, `az role assignment create`, or `./infra/assign-roles.sh models`), wait for it
to apply, and confirm the call returns `200`. On the Bicep + azd track, run `azd provision --no-state`: azd skips
a deployment when the templates and parameters haven't changed, and `--no-state` forces it, so the template
re-creates the assignment.

<!-- /steps -->

> **Checkpoint**
> You called a model with no API key, got `401` for a token with the wrong audience, and `403` while your
> identity had no role.

## Go further

- **Narrow the scope.** Replace the gateway-wide assignment with **AI Gateway Models User** on a single alias
  (`./infra/assign-roles.sh models "alias:<alias>"`). Calls to other aliases now return `403`.
- **Grant tools only.** Give an agent **AI Gateway Tools User** on one MCP server from
  [Federate MCP tools](../04-federate-mcp-tools/README.md), so it can list and call those tools but not
  invoke models.
- **Run without a user.** Deploy the Python sample to an Azure service with a managed identity, assign the
  role to that identity's principal ID, and the same code runs with app-only tokens for the `.default` scope.
  Agent identities work the same way.
- **Budget per person.** Add a cost limit with **Caller identity** as the counter dimension and an override for one Entra identity in
  [Enforce cost budgets](../07-cost-budgets/README.md). Each `tid` and `oid` pair gets its own budget.
- **See who called.** In **Monitoring** › **Settings**, **Token claim attributes** exports claims such as
  `tid`, `oid`, `appid`, and `azp` as `azure.ai_gateway.identity.claims.<claim>` attributes on logs, traces,
  and metrics. See [Monitor usage, cost, and traces](../13-monitoring/README.md).

## Clean up

Role assignments don't cost anything. Keep yours if you'll continue with Entra-based labs. Otherwise remove
it, and revoke any runtime keys you no longer need in **Access** › **Keys**.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Remove the role assignment

Select **Access** › **Entra ID**, find your assignment, and remove it.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Remove the role assignment

```bash title="Bash"
# Delete your AI Gateway Models User role assignment (a6b68e3d-…) on the gateway
az role assignment delete --assignee "$MY_OBJECT_ID" \
  --role "a6b68e3d-a1f0-4c60-8678-237c050cf4ea" --scope "$GATEWAY_ID" &&
  echo "🧹 Your AI Gateway Models User role assignment on $GATEWAY is deleted"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Delete your AI Gateway Models User role assignment (a6b68e3d-…) on the gateway
az role assignment delete --assignee $MY_OBJECT_ID `
  --role "a6b68e3d-a1f0-4c60-8678-237c050cf4ea" --scope $GATEWAY_ID
if ($?) { Write-Host "🧹 Your AI Gateway Models User role assignment on $GATEWAY is deleted" }
```

<!-- track: code | Code -->

### Remove local files

Delete `infra/.venv`, `infra/node_modules`, or `infra/bin` and `infra/obj`. Then remove the role assignment
with the Portal or Azure CLI track.

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Delete everything azd created

In the `ai-gateway/labs/11-entra-rbac` folder, delete the resource group with the gateway, the Foundry account, and
your role assignment. [`--purge`](../SETUP.md#delete-what-azd-created) also purges the soft-deleted Foundry account.
It takes about ten minutes.

```bash
# Delete everything that azd up created, and purge the Foundry account
azd down --purge --force &&
  echo "🧹 Everything that azd up created is deleted"
```

<!-- /tracks -->

`azd down` doesn't touch your gateway from lab 02 or its role assignments, because the Bicep + azd track created its
own gateway.
