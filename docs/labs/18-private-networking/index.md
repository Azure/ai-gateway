# Lock down backend traffic with private networking

Your security team wants model traffic kept off the public internet wherever the platform allows it. With AI
Gateway today, that's the hop from the gateway to your backends. In this lab you create a gateway with **private
routing**, so its outbound calls leave through a subnet in your virtual network. Then you give the Foundry
resource a private endpoint, turn off Foundry's public access, and prove that the gateway still reaches the model
while the internet can't.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Inbound private endpoints and disabling public network access aren't available for AI Gateway
> (`Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways`) yet. In the portal's create dialog, **Public network access** ›
> **Disabled** is greyed out with "Unavailable until private frontend access is supported", the gateway has no
> private endpoint connections, and setting `publicNetworkAccess` to `Disabled` through Azure Resource Manager has
> no effect. Clients keep calling the gateway on its public endpoint, so protect it with runtime keys or Microsoft
> Entra ID ([Issue and rotate runtime API keys](../10-api-keys/README.md),
> [Go keyless with Microsoft Entra ID and RBAC](../11-entra-rbac/README.md)) and an `ipFilter` policy
> ([Set gateway-wide policy baselines](../09-gateway-baselines/README.md)).

## Before you begin

<!-- setup: tools sign-in extension providers clone -->

> [!TIP]
> On the **Bicep + azd** track, `azd up` creates its own resource group, network, gateway, and a Foundry resource with
> `gpt-6-luna` that only this lab uses, so you can skip this section, including the variables. You need only the
> one-time setup above.

- Complete [Provision your AI Gateway](../01-provision-gateway/README.md) and
  [Call backends with managed identities](../12-backend-identity/README.md). You need a Foundry resource with a
  chat model deployment, for example `gpt-6-luna`.
- Private routing can only be chosen when a gateway is created, so this lab creates a **new** gateway. The
  gateway from the earlier labs stays as it is.
- Every track uses the Azure CLI for the checks.
- Permission to create a resource group, network resources, and a gateway, to change the Foundry resource, and
  to assign roles on it, for example **Owner**, or **Contributor** plus **Role Based Access Control
  Administrator**.
- A region where AI Gateway and `gpt-6-luna` are available, as in
  [Find the available regions](../SETUP.md#find-the-available-regions). The virtual network must be
  in the gateway's subscription and region.

> [!WARNING]
> Turning off public access on the Foundry resource blocks every caller that reaches it over the internet,
> including the gateway from the earlier labs, which has no private routing, and tools on your workstation. Use a
> dedicated Foundry resource for this lab if others depend on it, and re-enable public access when you clean up.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lab creates billable resources: a private endpoint and private DNS zones. Follow [Clean up](#clean-up) when
> you finish.

Set these variables once. The portal and Azure CLI tracks and the **Verify** section reuse them; the Bicep + azd
track sets the ones it needs from azd's outputs. The lab puts the new gateway and the network in their own
resource group, so clean-up is one command.

## How it works

A gateway has two network directions. **Inbound**, clients call the gateway's frontend on
`https://<gateway>.<region>-01.ai.gateway.azure.com`. **Outbound**, the gateway calls models, MCP servers, and
APIs. With **private routing**, the gateway joins a dedicated, delegated subnet in your virtual network and sends
its outbound calls through it, so it can reach backends on private IPs. When a backend's private DNS zones are
linked to that virtual network, the gateway resolves the backend's usual host name to its private endpoint IP.

You choose private routing when you create the gateway, and you can't add, change, or remove it afterwards: "Virtual
network integration for Azure AI Gateway can only be configured during creation." Most connectivity problems
after that are DNS: the gateway must resolve each backend to its private IP.

| Piece | Direction | Available today | Where you set it | Key values |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Integration subnet | Outbound | Yes | Your virtual network | At least `/27` (`/24` recommended), same subscription and region as the gateway, dedicated to one gateway, delegated to `Microsoft.App/environments`, NSG allows outbound TCP 443 to `Storage` and `AzureKeyVault` |
| Private routing | Outbound | Yes, at creation only | **Create AI gateway** › **Advanced** › **Private routing** | `properties.backend.subnet.id` set to the integration subnet |
| Backend private endpoints | Outbound | Yes | Each backend, plus its private DNS zones linked to the virtual network | Foundry uses the `account` group ID |
| Gateway private endpoint | Inbound | Not yet | — | The gateway has no private link resources |
| Public network access | Inbound | Always **Enabled** | — | **Disabled** is "Unavailable until private frontend access is supported" |
| IP filter | Inbound | Yes | Gateway-wide policy ([lab 09](../09-gateway-baselines/README.md)) | `ipFilter` with `action: Allow` and `cidrRanges` |

## Prepare the virtual network

You create one virtual network with two subnets. The integration subnet belongs to the new gateway alone, and
backend private endpoints get their own subnet.

| Subnet | Prefix | Used for | Settings |
|---|---|---|---|
| `snet-aigw-integration` | `10.20.0.0/24` | Gateway private routing (outbound) | NSG `nsg-aigw-integration`, delegated to `Microsoft.App/environments`, nothing else deployed in it |
| `snet-private-endpoints` | `10.20.1.0/24` | Private endpoints to backends such as Foundry | None |

Pick one track. The Bicep + azd track declares the network, the gateway, the Foundry resource and its private
endpoint, and the model in one azd project, so you deploy everything once in the next section.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Create the network security group

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a network security group named `nsg-aigw-integration`
in the lab's resource group and region. Add two **outbound** security rules:

| Name | Priority | Source | Destination (service tag) | Protocol | Destination port | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AllowStorageOutbound` | 100 | `VirtualNetwork` | `Storage` | TCP | `443` | Allow |
| `AllowKeyVaultOutbound` | 110 | `VirtualNetwork` | `AzureKeyVault` | TCP | `443` | Allow |

### Create the virtual network and subnets

Create a virtual network named `vnet-aigw` in the **same subscription and region as the new gateway**, with the
address space `10.20.0.0/16`. Add the two subnets from the table above. On `snet-aigw-integration`, select the
`nsg-aigw-integration` network security group and delegate the subnet to `Microsoft.App/environments`.

> **Checkpoint**
> The virtual network shows two subnets, and `snet-aigw-integration` lists the delegation
> `Microsoft.App/environments` and the NSG `nsg-aigw-integration`.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Create the network security group

```bash
# Create the network security group that the integration subnet uses
az network nsg create -g "$RG" -n "$NSG" -l "$LOCATION" -o none &&
  echo "🔒 NSG $NSG is ready"

# Allow outbound HTTPS (TCP 443) from the subnet to the Storage service tag, as the gateway's subnet checks require
az network nsg rule create -g "$RG" --nsg-name "$NSG" -n AllowStorageOutbound \
  --priority 100 --direction Outbound --access Allow --protocol Tcp \
  --source-address-prefixes VirtualNetwork \
  --destination-address-prefixes Storage --destination-port-ranges 443 -o none &&
  echo "🔒 NSG rule AllowStorageOutbound allows outbound TCP 443 to Storage"

# Allow outbound HTTPS (TCP 443) to the AzureKeyVault service tag, the other rule that the subnet checks require
az network nsg rule create -g "$RG" --nsg-name "$NSG" -n AllowKeyVaultOutbound \
  --priority 110 --direction Outbound --access Allow --protocol Tcp \
  --source-address-prefixes VirtualNetwork \
  --destination-address-prefixes AzureKeyVault --destination-port-ranges 443 -o none &&
  echo "🔒 NSG rule AllowKeyVaultOutbound allows outbound TCP 443 to AzureKeyVault"
```

### Create the virtual network and subnets

```bash
# Create the virtual network, with an address space that holds both subnets
az network vnet create -g "$RG" -n "$VNET" -l "$LOCATION" --address-prefixes 10.20.0.0/16 -o none &&
  echo "🔒 Virtual network $VNET is ready in $LOCATION"

# Create the integration subnet for the gateway alone: delegated to Microsoft.App/environments, with the NSG
az network vnet subnet create -g "$RG" --vnet-name "$VNET" -n "$INTEGRATION_SUBNET" \
  --address-prefixes 10.20.0.0/24 \
  --delegations Microsoft.App/environments --network-security-group "$NSG" -o none &&
  echo "🔒 Integration subnet $INTEGRATION_SUBNET (10.20.0.0/24) is ready"

# Create the subnet that holds the private endpoints to backends such as Foundry
az network vnet subnet create -g "$RG" --vnet-name "$VNET" -n "$PE_SUBNET" --address-prefixes 10.20.1.0/24 -o none &&
  echo "🔒 Private endpoint subnet $PE_SUBNET (10.20.1.0/24) is ready"
```

> **Checkpoint**
> This command shows the `/24` prefix, the `Microsoft.App/environments` delegation, and the NSG:
>
> ```bash
> # Show the integration subnet's prefix, delegation, and NSG
> echo "🔒 Prefix, delegation, and NSG of $INTEGRATION_SUBNET, the integration subnet:"
> az network vnet subnet show -g "$RG" --vnet-name "$VNET" -n "$INTEGRATION_SUBNET" \
>   --query "{prefix:addressPrefix, delegation:delegations[0].serviceName, nsg:networkSecurityGroup.id}"
> ```

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

**What you need:** only the one-time setup from **Before you begin**. This track doesn't use your gateway or Foundry
resource from the earlier labs: `azd up` creates new ones, so it works on its own.

### Review the templates

`infra/main.bicep` creates the resource group `rg-<environment name>` and calls three modules: a Foundry resource
for this lab, the network with the gateway, and the template from
[Make your first model call](../02-first-model-call/README.md),
[publish-model.bicep](../02-first-model-call/infra/publish-model.bicep). That last one grants the gateway's
identity the **Foundry User** role on the Foundry resource, creates the `foundry-private` provider and the
`gpt-6-luna` model, publishes the `private-chat` alias, and creates the `private-net-lab` runtime key:

<!-- include: infra/main.bicep -->

`infra/private-network.bicep` declares the NSG, the virtual network and its two subnets, and the gateway itself.
It creates the gateway with the template from [Provision your AI Gateway](../01-provision-gateway/README.md),
[gateway.bicep](../01-provision-gateway/infra/gateway.bicep), used as a module, and passes the integration subnet
in its `backendSubnetId` parameter, which becomes `properties.backend.subnet.id`. When you pass a Foundry resource
ID in `foundryAccountId`, it also adds a private endpoint to Foundry with the `account` group ID, the three Foundry
private DNS zones, their virtual network links, and a DNS zone group. You can also deploy it on its own to an
existing resource group.

There's no inbound private endpoint and no `publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'` for the gateway in the template,
because the `aigateways` resource type doesn't support them yet.

<!-- include: infra/private-network.bicep -->

`infra/foundry.bicep` creates the Foundry resource with local authentication turned off and a `gpt-6-luna`
deployment. Its `publicNetworkAccess` parameter starts as `Enabled`, and you turn it off later in the lab:

<!-- include: infra/foundry.bicep -->

> **Checkpoint**
> You know what `azd up` creates. You deploy it in the next section.

<!-- /tracks -->

## Create the gateway with private routing

Private routing is part of the create request. Select the integration subnet now: if you skip it, the only way to
add it later is to create another gateway.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Enter the gateway details

1. Open the [AI Gateway portal](https://ai.gateway.azure.com). Open the gateway switcher in the top bar and start
   creating a new gateway.
2. In **Create AI gateway**, enter the new gateway's **Name**, then choose the subscription, the
   `rg-ai-gateway-private` **Resource group** (**Existing**), and the **Region** that matches the virtual network.
3. Under **Advanced**, keep **Enable system-assigned managed identity** selected and **Public network access**
   set to **Enabled**. **Disabled** is greyed out: "Unavailable until private frontend access is supported".

### Choose private routing

1. Select **Private routing** ("Allow access to private backends through secure outbound connections").
2. In **Virtual network**, select `vnet-aigw`. In **Subnet**, select `snet-aigw-integration`.
3. The portal checks the subnet: same subscription and region as the gateway, at least `/27` (`/24` leaves room to
   scale), the subnet delegation, dedicated to one gateway, and an NSG that allows outbound TCP 443 to the
   `Storage` and `AzureKeyVault` service tags. Fix anything it flags before you continue, except the delegation
   warning described in the note after these steps.
4. Select **Create gateway** and wait for provisioning to finish.

> [!NOTE]
> The portal's check **Subnet delegated to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms** still expects the old delegation, so it
> shows a warning: `Subnet "snet-aigw-integration" is delegated to Microsoft.App/environments instead.` The
> service requires `Microsoft.App/environments`, so continue. The warning doesn't block the create.

> **Checkpoint**
> The gateway switcher shows the new gateway, and **Home** opens with the setup guide.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

If you haven't yet, [register the resource providers](../SETUP.md#register-the-resource-providers) in this
subscription, including `Microsoft.Network` for this lab.

### Create the connector gateway

Every AI gateway has a companion `Microsoft.Web/connectorGateways` resource with the same name. The `aigateway`
extension creates only the AI gateway, so create the connector gateway through the Azure Resource Manager REST API
with `az rest`.

```bash title="Bash"
# Create the gateway's companion connector gateway, which the aigateway extension doesn't create
az rest --method put \
  --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG/providers/Microsoft.Web/connectorGateways/$GATEWAY?api-version=2026-05-01-preview" \
  --body "$(jq -cn --arg location "$LOCATION" '{location: $location, properties: {}}')" -o none &&
  echo "🔌 Connector gateway $GATEWAY is ready"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Create the gateway's companion connector gateway, which the aigateway extension doesn't create
@{ location = $LOCATION; properties = @{} } | ConvertTo-Json -Compress | Set-Content body.json
az rest --method put `
  --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG/providers/Microsoft.Web/connectorGateways/${GATEWAY}?api-version=2026-05-01-preview" `
  --body "@body.json" -o none
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔌 Connector gateway $GATEWAY is ready" }
Remove-Item body.json
```

### Create the gateway in the integration subnet

The command is the same as in lab 01, plus `--subnet`, which sets `properties.backend.subnet.id`. It waits until
provisioning finishes, usually within a few minutes.

```bash title="Bash"
# Read the resource ID of the integration subnet
SUBNET_ID="$(az network vnet subnet show -g "$RG" --vnet-name "$VNET" -n "$INTEGRATION_SUBNET" --query id -o tsv)"
echo "🆔 Integration subnet: $SUBNET_ID"

# Create the gateway with a system-assigned managed identity and private routing through the integration subnet,
# which you can't change later; the command waits until provisioning finishes
az aigateway create -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" --location "$LOCATION" --system-assigned true \
  --subnet "$SUBNET_ID" -o none &&
  echo "🚀 Gateway $GATEWAY is ready, with private routing through $INTEGRATION_SUBNET"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Read the resource ID of the integration subnet
$SUBNET_ID = az network vnet subnet show -g $RG --vnet-name $VNET -n $INTEGRATION_SUBNET --query id -o tsv
Write-Host "🆔 Integration subnet: $SUBNET_ID"

# Create the gateway with a system-assigned managed identity and private routing through the integration subnet,
# which you can't change later; the command waits until provisioning finishes
az aigateway create -g $RG -n $GATEWAY --location $LOCATION --system-assigned true `
  --subnet $SUBNET_ID -o none
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚀 Gateway $GATEWAY is ready, with private routing through $INTEGRATION_SUBNET" }
```

> **Checkpoint**
> `az aigateway create` returns without an error, usually within a few minutes, and the commands print
> `🚀 Gateway <private-gateway> is ready, with private routing through snet-aigw-integration`.

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Deploy with azd up

Move into the lab's folder, create an azd environment named `aigw-lab18` in your current subscription, then provision
everything. It takes about seven minutes.

```bash title="Bash"
# Move into the lab's folder, which holds the azd project
cd ~/ai-gateway/labs/18-private-networking &&
  echo "📂 Lab folder: $(pwd)"

# Create an azd environment in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab18 --location eastus2 --subscription "$(az account show --query id --output tsv)" &&
  echo "📝 azd environment aigw-lab18 deploys to eastus2"

# Provision the network, the gateway with private routing, Foundry with its private endpoint, and the model
azd up &&
  echo "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Move into the lab's folder, which holds the azd project
Set-Location ~/ai-gateway/labs/18-private-networking
if ($?) { Write-Host "📂 Lab folder: $(Get-Location)" }

# Create an azd environment in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab18 --location eastus2 --subscription (az account show --query id --output tsv)
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 azd environment aigw-lab18 deploys to eastus2" }

# Provision the network, the gateway with private routing, Foundry with its private endpoint, and the model
azd up
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)" }
```

For another region, pick one where AI Gateway and the `gpt-6-luna` model are available, as in [Find the available
regions](../SETUP.md#find-the-available-regions). The Foundry resource's public access comes
from the `FOUNDRY_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ACCESS` azd environment value, with the default `Enabled` in
`infra/main.parameters.json`.

Bicep has no type definitions yet for `Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways` and `Microsoft.Web/connectorGateways`,
so the templates silence the `BCP081` warnings about them with `#disable-next-line BCP081`.

### Read the outputs and the key

Set the variables that the next sections and **Verify** use from azd's environment values, and read the key from
the gateway so that it never shows on screen:

```bash title="Bash"
# Read azd's outputs: the resource group, the gateway, the key's name, Foundry's private endpoint and endpoint,
# the gateway's runtime URL, and the alias
export RG="$(azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)"

<!-- /tracks -->

Whichever track you used, load the runtime URL and confirm that the gateway uses the integration subnet:

```bash title="Bash"
# Read the gateway's runtime URL
export AI_GATEWAY_URL="https://$(az aigateway show -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" --query properties.frontend.defaultHostname -o tsv)"
echo "🌐 Runtime URL: $AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Show the gateway's provisioning state, the subnet that its outbound calls go through, and its host name
echo "🔒 Gateway $GATEWAY and its private routing:"
az aigateway show -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" \
  --query "{state:properties.provisioningState, backendSubnet:properties.backend.subnet.id, host:properties.frontend.defaultHostname}"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Read the gateway's runtime URL
$env:AI_GATEWAY_URL = "https://$(az aigateway show -g $RG -n $GATEWAY --query properties.frontend.defaultHostname -o tsv)"
Write-Host "🌐 Runtime URL: $env:AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Show the gateway's provisioning state, the subnet that its outbound calls go through, and its host name
Write-Host "🔒 Gateway $GATEWAY and its private routing:"
az aigateway show -g $RG -n $GATEWAY `
  --query "{state:properties.provisioningState, backendSubnet:properties.backend.subnet.id, host:properties.frontend.defaultHostname}"
```

The commands print the runtime URL, for example
`🌐 Runtime URL: https://<private-gateway>.eastus2-01.ai.gateway.azure.com`, and then the gateway's settings:

```json
{
  "state": "Succeeded",
  "backendSubnet": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-ai-gateway-private/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-aigw/subnets/snet-aigw-integration",
  "host": "<private-gateway>.eastus2-01.ai.gateway.azure.com"
}
```

## Give Foundry a private endpoint

The gateway now sends outbound calls through your virtual network, but Foundry still resolves to its public IP.
Give the Foundry resource a private endpoint in `snet-private-endpoints` and link its private DNS zones to the
virtual network, so the gateway resolves Foundry to a private IP.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Add a private endpoint to Foundry

In the Azure portal, open your Foundry resource and add a private endpoint named `pe-foundry-<private-gateway>`
in the lab's resource group, in `vnet-aigw` › `snet-private-endpoints`, for the `account` sub-resource, with
private DNS integration turned on. The private DNS zones for Foundry are
`privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com`, `privatelink.openai.azure.com`, and `privatelink.services.ai.azure.com`.
For the full walkthrough, see
[How to configure network isolation for Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/configure-private-link).

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Add a private endpoint to Foundry

```bash
# Create a private endpoint in the private endpoint subnet to the Foundry account's account sub-resource
az network private-endpoint create -g "$RG" -n "$FOUNDRY_PE" -l "$LOCATION" \
  --vnet-name "$VNET" --subnet "$PE_SUBNET" \
  --private-connection-resource-id "$FOUNDRY_ID" --group-id account --connection-name foundry -o none &&
  echo "🔒 Private endpoint $FOUNDRY_PE connects $PE_SUBNET to Foundry"
```

### Link the Foundry private DNS zones

Create each zone, link it to the virtual network, and add it to the endpoint's DNS zone group:

```bash title="Bash"
# For each Foundry private DNS zone: the first one creates the endpoint's DNS zone group, the others join it
first=true
for zone in privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com privatelink.openai.azure.com privatelink.services.ai.azure.com; do
  # Create the zone, and link it to the virtual network without auto-registration of records (-e false)

  az network private-dns link vnet create -g "$RG" -z "$zone" -n "$VNET-link" -v "$VNET" -e false -o none &&
    echo "🔒 $zone is linked to $VNET"

  # Add the zone to the private endpoint's DNS zone group, so that Foundry's private IP gets an A record in it
  if $first; then action=create; first=false; else action=add; fi

### Check what azd created

`azd up` passed the lab's Foundry resource to `infra/private-network.bicep` in `foundryAccountId`, so it already
created the private endpoint, the three private DNS zones, their virtual network links, and the DNS zone group.
Check them with the commands in the next checkpoint.

## Publish a model on the new gateway

The new gateway starts empty. Publish your Foundry deployment on it, as in
[Make your first model call](../02-first-model-call/README.md), and create a runtime API key. The gateway calls
Foundry with its own system-assigned managed identity, which needs the **Foundry User** role on the account.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Import the deployment from Foundry

1. In the [AI Gateway portal](https://ai.gateway.azure.com), select the new gateway in the top bar.
2. Select **Models** › **Add** › **Models from Microsoft Foundry**.
3. Select the subscription and resource group of your Foundry account, then select your deployment and keep
   **Managed identity** as the **Authentication method**.
4. Under **Aliases**, keep **Create an alias for each model** selected, then select **Add models**.
5. Open the imported model on **Models**, open the **Aliases** tab, and copy the alias exactly as shown.

### Create a runtime API key

Select **Access** › **Keys** › **Create API key**, enter `private-net-lab` in **Key name**, select **Create**,
and copy the value. Then set both values in your shell without echoing the key:

```bash title="Bash"
# Set the alias that apps send in the model field
export AI_GATEWAY_MODEL="<model-name>"    # the alias from the Aliases tab
echo "🔖 Model alias: $AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"

# Read the key without showing it, and export it for the next commands
read -rsp "AI Gateway API key: " AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && echo
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Set the alias that apps send in the model field, and read the key without showing it
$env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL   = "<model-name>"  # the alias from the Aliases tab
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = Read-Host "AI Gateway API key" -MaskInput
Write-Host "🔖 Model alias: $env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Grant the gateway access to Foundry

```bash title="Bash"
# Read the principal ID of the new gateway's managed identity
PRINCIPAL_ID="$(az aigateway show -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" --query identity.principalId -o tsv)"
echo "👤 Gateway identity: $PRINCIPAL_ID"

# Give the gateway's identity the Foundry User role on the account, so that it can call the model
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "$PRINCIPAL_ID" --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \
  --role "53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d" --scope "$FOUNDRY_ID" -o none &&
  echo "🔐 The gateway's identity has the Foundry User role on $FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Read the principal ID of the new gateway's managed identity
$PRINCIPAL_ID = az aigateway show -g $RG -n $GATEWAY --query identity.principalId -o tsv
Write-Host "👤 Gateway identity: $PRINCIPAL_ID"

# Give the gateway's identity the Foundry User role on the account, so that it can call the model
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $PRINCIPAL_ID --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal `
  --role "53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d" --scope $FOUNDRY_ID -o none
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔐 The gateway's identity has the Foundry User role on $FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT" }
```

`53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d` is the **Foundry User** role.

### Publish the deployment and an alias

Create a provider that signs in to Foundry with the gateway's managed identity, register the deployment under it,
and publish an alias.

```bash title="Bash"
# Add a model provider that points at the Foundry account and signs in with the gateway's managed identity
az aigateway model-provider create -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n "$PROVIDER" \
  --kind Foundry --display-name "Foundry (private)" \
  --foundry "{endpoint:'$FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT',resourceIds:[$FOUNDRY_ID],authentication:{kind:ManagedIdentity,managedIdentity:{resource:'https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/'}}}" -o none &&
  echo "🔌 Model provider $PROVIDER points at $FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT"

# Add a model for the deployment, with the endpoints that apps can call
az aigateway model create -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" --provider-name "$PROVIDER" -n "$DEPLOYMENT" \
  --display-name "$DEPLOYMENT" --api-format OpenAIChatCompletions \
  --supported-endpoints /openai/v1/chat/completions /openai/v1/responses \
  --deployment-config "{resourceId:$FOUNDRY_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT,modelName:$DEPLOYMENT}" -o none &&
  echo "✨ Model $DEPLOYMENT is published through $PROVIDER"

# Build the model's resource ID, and publish (or update) the alias that apps send in the model field
MODEL_ID="$GATEWAY_ID/workspaces/default/modelProviders/$PROVIDER/models/$DEPLOYMENT"
az aigateway model-alias set -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n "$ALIAS" \
  --backend-model resource-id="$MODEL_ID" --only-show-errors -o none &&
  echo "🔖 Alias $ALIAS is ready"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Add a model provider that points at the Foundry account and signs in with the gateway's managed identity
az aigateway model-provider create -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n $PROVIDER `
  --kind Foundry --display-name "Foundry (private)" `
  --foundry "{endpoint:'$FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT',resourceIds:[$FOUNDRY_ID],authentication:{kind:ManagedIdentity,managedIdentity:{resource:'https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/'}}}" -o none
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔌 Model provider $PROVIDER points at $FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT" }

# Add a model for the deployment, with the endpoints that apps can call
az aigateway model create -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY --provider-name $PROVIDER -n $DEPLOYMENT `
  --display-name $DEPLOYMENT --api-format OpenAIChatCompletions `
  --supported-endpoints /openai/v1/chat/completions /openai/v1/responses `
  --deployment-config "{resourceId:$FOUNDRY_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT,modelName:$DEPLOYMENT}" -o none
if ($?) { Write-Host "✨ Model $DEPLOYMENT is published through $PROVIDER" }

# Build the model's resource ID, and publish (or update) the alias that apps send in the model field
$MODEL_ID = "$GATEWAY_ID/workspaces/default/modelProviders/$PROVIDER/models/$DEPLOYMENT"
az aigateway model-alias set -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n $ALIAS `
  --backend-model resource-id="$MODEL_ID" --only-show-errors -o none
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔖 Alias $ALIAS is ready" }
```

`az aigateway model-alias set` creates the alias, or updates it if it exists, so you can run the step again.

### Create a runtime API key

`api-key create` returns metadata only. Read the generated value with `list-secrets` straight into a variable, so
it never appears on screen.

```bash title="Bash"
# Create a runtime API key for your app
az aigateway api-key create -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n "$KEY_NAME" --display-name "$KEY_NAME" -o none &&
  echo "🔑 API key private-net-lab is ready"

# Read the key straight into a variable, so that it never shows on screen, and set the alias for the next calls
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$(az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n "$KEY_NAME" \
  --query primaryKey -o tsv)" && export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY
export AI_GATEWAY_MODEL="$ALIAS"
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"
echo "🔖 Model alias: $AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Create a runtime API key for your app
az aigateway api-key create -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n $KEY_NAME --display-name $KEY_NAME -o none
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔑 API key private-net-lab is ready" }

# Read the key straight into a variable, so that it never shows on screen, and set the alias for the next calls
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n $KEY_NAME `
  --query primaryKey -o tsv
$env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL   = $ALIAS
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"
Write-Host "🔖 Model alias: $env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"
```

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Check the model and the key

`azd up` also deployed lab 02's template on the new gateway: the gateway's identity has the **Foundry User** role
on the lab's Foundry resource, and the gateway has the `foundry-private` provider, the `gpt-6-luna` model, the
`private-chat` alias, and the `private-net-lab` runtime key. You read the alias and the key into `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL`
and `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` in the previous section. Check where the alias points:

```bash
# Show the resource ID of the model that the alias points at
echo "🔖 Alias $AI_GATEWAY_MODEL points at this model:"
az aigateway model-alias show -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n "$AI_GATEWAY_MODEL" \
  --query "properties.backendModels[0].resourceId" -o tsv
```

The output ends with `/modelProviders/foundry-private/models/gpt-6-luna`.

## Turn off public access to Foundry

The gateway resolves Foundry through the private DNS zones, so its calls already use the private endpoint. Turn
off Foundry's public access, so the private endpoint is the only way in.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Disable public network access on Foundry

After the private endpoint shows as approved, open the Foundry resource's networking settings in the Azure portal
and disable public network access. See
[Configure virtual networks for Foundry Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks).

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Disable public network access on Foundry

```bash
# Turn off public network access on the Foundry account, so that the private endpoint is the only way in
echo "🔒 Public network access of the Foundry account, after the update:"
az resource update --ids "$FOUNDRY_ID" --set properties.publicNetworkAccess=Disabled \
  --query properties.publicNetworkAccess -o tsv
```

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Disable public network access on Foundry

`infra/foundry.bicep` takes the Foundry resource's public access from the `FOUNDRY_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ACCESS` azd
environment value. Set it to `Disabled` and provision again. azd updates the Foundry resource, and the gateway keeps
its private routing, because the template passes the same subnet:

```bash
# Set Foundry's public network access to Disabled in the azd environment
azd env set FOUNDRY_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ACCESS Disabled &&
  echo "📝 FOUNDRY_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ACCESS is Disabled in the azd environment"

# Provision again: azd updates the Foundry resource, and the gateway keeps its private routing
azd provision &&
  echo "🔒 Foundry's public network access is off"
```

<!-- /tracks -->

The change can take a few minutes to apply.

## Verify

<!-- steps -->

### Check the gateway's private routing

```bash
# Show the subnet that the gateway's outbound calls go through
echo "🔒 Gateway $GATEWAY routes its outbound calls through this subnet:"
az aigateway show -g "$RG" -n "$GATEWAY" --query "properties.backend.subnet.id" -o tsv
```

The output ends with `/virtualNetworks/vnet-aigw/subnets/snet-aigw-integration`.

### Check name resolution for Foundry

```bash
# List the A records that the private endpoint registered in the zone
echo "🔒 A records in privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com:"
az network private-dns record-set a list -g "$RG" -z privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com \
  --query "[].{name:name, ip:aRecords[0].ipv4Address}" -o table
```

The Foundry account resolves to an IP in `snet-private-endpoints` (`10.20.1.x`) for anything that uses the
virtual network's DNS, including the gateway.

### Call the model through the gateway

```bash title="Bash"
# Call the model through the gateway, and print only the HTTP status code
echo "🔒 Model call through the gateway, with Foundry's public access off:"
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w 'HTTP %{http_code}\n' "${AI_GATEWAY_URL%/}/default/models/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "api-key: $AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$AI_GATEWAY_MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly one word: ok\"}],\"max_completion_tokens\":128}"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Build a short request with the alias in model
$body = @{ model = $env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL; max_completion_tokens = 128
  messages = @(@{ role = "user"; content = "Reply with exactly one word: ok" }) } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5

# Call the model through the gateway; -SkipHttpErrorCheck returns error responses instead of throwing
Write-Host "🔒 Model call through the gateway, with Foundry's public access off:"
$r = Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -Uri "$env:AI_GATEWAY_URL/default/models/openai/v1/chat/completions" `
  -Headers @{ "api-key" = $env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY } -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body -SkipHttpErrorCheck
"HTTP $($r.StatusCode)"
```

The call still returns `HTTP 200`. Your workstation reaches the gateway on its public endpoint, and the gateway
reaches Foundry through the integration subnet and the private endpoint.

### Call Foundry directly from your workstation

```bash title="Bash"
# Get a Microsoft Entra token for Foundry with your own sign-in
TOKEN="$(az account get-access-token --resource https://cognitiveservices.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv)"
echo "👤 Token acquired: in TOKEN (${#TOKEN} characters, not shown)"

# Call Foundry's public endpoint directly, and print the response and the HTTP status code
echo "🚦 Direct call to Foundry from your workstation (expect HTTP 403):"
curl -sS -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n' "${FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT%/}/openai/v1/models" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Get a Microsoft Entra token for Foundry with your own sign-in
$TOKEN = az account get-access-token --resource https://cognitiveservices.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv
Write-Host "👤 Token acquired: in TOKEN ($($TOKEN.Length) characters, not shown)"

# Call Foundry's public endpoint directly; -SkipHttpErrorCheck returns error responses instead of throwing
Write-Host "🚦 Direct call to Foundry from your workstation (expect HTTP 403):"
$r = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$($FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT.TrimEnd('/'))/openai/v1/models" `
  -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" } -SkipHttpErrorCheck
"HTTP $($r.StatusCode)"; $r.Content
```

The call returns `HTTP 403` with a message that public access is disabled: the internet can't reach Foundry
anymore, but the gateway can.

<!-- /steps -->

> **Checkpoint**
> The new gateway uses private routing through `snet-aigw-integration`, Foundry resolves to a `10.20.1.x` address
> inside the virtual network, model calls through the gateway return `200`, and direct calls to Foundry from the
> internet return `403`.

## Go further

- **Filter who can call the gateway.** While the frontend stays public, add a gateway-wide `ipFilter` policy
  (`action: Allow` with your egress `cidrRanges`) next to keys or Microsoft Entra ID. See
  [Set gateway-wide policy baselines](../09-gateway-baselines/README.md).
- **Hub-and-spoke networks.** Keep backend private endpoints and their private DNS zones in a hub, peer the
  gateway's virtual network to it, and link the zones to the integrated virtual network. If you use your own DNS
  servers, forward the `privatelink` zones to Azure DNS. See
  [Azure private endpoint DNS configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns).
- **Private MCP servers and APIs.** Any backend with a private endpoint or a private IP that the integrated
  virtual network can reach works the same way, including the tool servers from
  [Federate MCP tools behind one endpoint](../04-federate-mcp-tools/README.md).
- **Data residency.** Residency follows the whole request path, so account for where your backends, tools, logs,
  and clients live, not only the gateway region.

## Clean up

On the portal and Azure CLI tracks, re-enable Foundry's public access first, because the gateway from the earlier
labs and other callers reach it over the internet. Then remove the new gateway's role assignment on Foundry and
delete the lab's resource group, which holds the gateway, its connector gateway, the private endpoint, the private
DNS zones, the virtual network, and the NSG.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Delete the lab's resources

In the Azure portal, re-enable public network access on the Foundry resource, remove the new gateway's
**Foundry User** role assignment in its **Access control (IAM)**, and delete `rg-ai-gateway-private`.

If you put the lab's resources in a resource group you want to keep, delete them in this order instead: the
gateway and its connector gateway, then the private endpoint, the private DNS zone links and zones, the virtual
network, and the NSG.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Delete the lab's resources

```bash title="Bash"
# Turn Foundry's public network access back on, for the gateway from the earlier labs and other callers
echo "🔒 Public network access of the Foundry account, after the update:"

If you put the lab's resources in a resource group you want to keep, delete them in this order instead: the
gateway and its connector gateway, then the private endpoint, the private DNS zone links and zones, the virtual

### Delete everything azd created

In the `ai-gateway/labs/18-private-networking` folder, delete the resource group with the gateway, the network, the
private endpoint and DNS zones, and the lab's Foundry resource. [`--purge`](../SETUP.md#delete-what-azd-created) also
purges the soft-deleted Foundry resource. It takes about ten minutes.

```bash
# Delete everything that azd up created, and purge the soft-deleted Foundry resource
azd down --purge --force &&
  echo "🚮 Everything that azd up created is deleted"
```

<!-- /tracks -->

Keep the gateway, model, and key from the earlier labs. The next labs reuse them. `azd down` doesn't touch them,
because the Bicep + azd track created its own gateway and Foundry resource.

## Next steps

- [Deploy an enterprise reference architecture](../21-enterprise-reference/README.md): put the gateway, models,
  tools, policies, and telemetry in one repeatable deployment.
- [Set gateway-wide policy baselines](../09-gateway-baselines/README.md): add an IP filter to the public
  frontend.
- [Go keyless with Microsoft Entra ID and RBAC](../11-entra-rbac/README.md): combine network isolation with identity.
- [Monitor usage, cost, and traces](../13-monitoring/README.md): confirm that private traffic still produces
  telemetry.
- Docs: [Networking](https://ai.gateway.azure.com/docs/networking).
