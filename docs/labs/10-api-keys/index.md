  - Declare the keys with Bicep and azd, and keep rotation and revocation as operations
  - Rotate a key without downtime by moving clients between its primary and secondary values
  - Revoke a leaked key and confirm that the gateway rejects it with 401
  - Find usage and estimated cost for each key in Monitoring
  - Decide when to replace API keys with Microsoft Entra ID

# Issue and rotate runtime API keys

Three callers now use your gateway: the `app-dev` web app, the `support-bot` agent, and a data scientist's
notebook that was shared with the whole company, key included. In this lab you give each caller its own runtime
API key, keep the values in a secret store, rotate the bot's key without taking it offline, and revoke the
leaked notebook key. Because every key is a separate caller identity, you can also see who used what.

![Callers reach the gateway with an API key or a Microsoft Entra token, and the gateway reaches providers with its own credentials](../assets/diagrams/identity-boundaries.svg "Inbound, apps send an api-key header or a Microsoft Entra token. Outbound, the gateway uses its managed identity or a provider key that it stores. Callers never receive backend credentials.")

## Before you begin

<!-- setup: tools sign-in extension clone -->

> [!TIP]
> On the **Bicep + azd** track, `azd up` creates its own gateway, model, and keys, so you can skip this section. You
> need only the one-time setup above.

- Complete [Provision your AI Gateway](../01-provision-gateway/README.md). You need the gateway, its resource
  group, and its runtime URL.
- Recommended: complete [Publish a Foundry model and make your first call](../02-first-model-call/README.md),
  so you have a model alias to call. The checks in this lab call that alias. The gateway answers `404` for an
  alias it doesn't know before it checks the key, so without a real alias the checks can't tell accepted keys
  from rejected keys.
- Permission to manage the gateway's keys, for example **Contributor** on its resource group. Reading a key
  value needs `Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways/apiKeys/listSecrets/action`, which **Contributor** includes.
- Optional: an Azure Key Vault that uses Azure RBAC, where you have **Key Vault Secrets Officer**. You can create
  one below.
- Optional, for usage and cost per key: monitoring configured in
  [Monitor usage, cost, and traces](../13-monitoring/README.md).
- Run the scripts and samples from the lab's folder, `~/ai-gateway/labs/10-api-keys`.

Set these variables once. Every track and the **Verify** section reuse them.

<summary>No Key Vault yet? Create one for this lab.</summary>

Key Vault names are globally unique, 3 to 24 characters. The vault uses Azure RBAC, and you get
**Key Vault Secrets Officer** so you can write and read secrets. A new role assignment can take a few minutes to
apply.

```bash title="Bash"
# Name the vault with a random number, because Key Vault names are globally unique

## How it works

A runtime API key is a gateway resource with a name and two values, **primary** and **secondary**.
Both values work at the same time, which is what makes rotation without downtime possible. Clients send either
value in the `api-key` header. The model endpoint also accepts it as a bearer token, which is how OpenAI SDKs
send their API key, but a request with both headers gets `400`. The gateway validates the key before it applies
policies or forwards the request, so a missing, wrong, rotated, or deleted value, or a suspended key, gets
`401 Unauthorized` and never reaches a model.

A key is gateway-scoped: it grants access to every published model and MCP server on the gateway. Each key is
also a separate caller identity, which token limits, cost limits, and Monitoring use to tell callers apart.
That's why every app, agent, or user should get its own key.

| Task | Portal (**Access** › **Keys**) | Azure CLI (`az aigateway api-key`) | Bicep (`aigateways/apiKeys`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create a key | **Create API key** | `create` | Declare the key |
| Read a value | **View keys** (primary value) | `list-secrets` (primary and secondary values) | — (never an output) |
| Rotate | **Rotate key** (primary value) | `regenerate --key-type primary` or `--key-type secondary` | — |
| Block temporarily | — | `az rest` `PATCH` with `state` set to `suspended`, then back to `active` | — |
| Revoke | **Delete** | `delete` | — (removing the key from the template doesn't delete it) |

The gateway also has a built-in key named `master`. Don't hand it out; create named keys instead.

## Create a key for each app

Create three keys: `app-dev` for the web app, `support-bot` for the agent, and `old-notebook`, which stands in
for the key that leaked. Pick one track.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Create the first key

1. In the [AI Gateway portal](https://ai.gateway.azure.com), open your gateway and select **Access** › **Keys**.
2. Select **Create API key**.
3. In **Key name**, enter `app-dev`, and select **Create**.
4. The **API key created successfully** dialog shows the value. Select **Copy & done**.

Store the value right away; the next section shows where. After you close the dialog, only people with the
`apiKeys/listSecrets/action` permission, such as Contributors, can display the value again, with **View keys**.

### Create the other two keys

Repeat the steps for `support-bot` and `old-notebook`. Names must be unique, ignoring case; a duplicate gets
`A key named "..." already exists.` The portal derives the key's resource name from **Key name**: lowercase, with
every character other than letters, digits, and hyphens replaced by `-`. Use that resource name with the CLI.

### Load a value in your shell

Select the **…** (**More actions**) button on the `app-dev` row, select **View keys**, and copy the value. Paste it
into your shell for the checks in this lab:

```bash title="Bash"
# Paste the key without showing it, and export it for the checks in this lab
read -rsp "AI Gateway API key: " AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY && echo
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Paste the key without showing it, and keep it in an environment variable for the checks in this lab
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = Read-Host "AI Gateway API key" -MaskInput
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Create the keys

`create` needs a display name, but the service replaces it with its own, so identify keys by `name`.

```bash title="Bash"
# Create one runtime API key for each caller: the web app, the agent, and the notebook whose key leaks
for KEY in app-dev support-bot old-notebook; do
  az aigateway api-key create -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n "$KEY" --display-name "$KEY" -o none &&
    echo "🔑 API key $KEY is ready"
done

# List the gateway's keys and their state, without their values
echo "🔑 API keys on $GATEWAY:"
az aigateway api-key list -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" --query "[].{name:name, state:properties.state}" -o table
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Create one runtime API key for each caller: the web app, the agent, and the notebook whose key leaks
foreach ($key in "app-dev", "support-bot", "old-notebook") {
  az aigateway api-key create -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n $key --display-name $key -o none
  if ($?) { Write-Host "🔑 API key $key is ready" }
}

# List the gateway's keys and their state, without their values
Write-Host "🔑 API keys on ${GATEWAY}:"
az aigateway api-key list -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY --query "[].{name:name, state:properties.state}" -o table
```

The list also shows the built-in `master` key, and every key is `active`. `create`, `list`, and `show` never
return key values.

### Load a value in your shell

`az aigateway api-key list-secrets` returns `primaryKey` and `secondaryKey`. Capture the value in a variable
instead of printing it:

```bash title="Bash"
# Read the primary value of the app-dev key into an environment variable, without showing it
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$(az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n app-dev \
  --query primaryKey -o tsv)"
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Read the primary value of the app-dev key into an environment variable, without showing it
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n app-dev `
  --query primaryKey -o tsv
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

**What you need:** only the one-time setup from **Before you begin**. This track doesn't use your gateway from earlier
labs: `azd up` creates a new one, so it works on its own.

### Choose what to declare

A key is a child resource of the gateway, `Microsoft.ApiManagement/aigateways/apiKeys`, so a template can declare
which keys exist. Their values aren't in the template: the gateway generates them, and a later deployment keeps
them. Rotating and revoking a key are operations, not declarations, so you run them with the Azure CLI in the next
sections.

### Review the templates

`infra/main.bicep` creates the resource group `rg-<environment name>` and calls the quick start's
[resources.bicep](../quickstart/infra/resources.bicep) for the gateway, the Foundry model, its default alias, and the
`app-first-call` key, so the checks have an alias to call. Then it calls `infra/api-keys.bicep` with the key names:

<!-- include: infra/main.bicep -->

`infra/api-keys.bicep` declares one key for each name. It only references the gateway, so you can also deploy it on
its own to a gateway you already have, with `az deployment group create`:

<!-- include: infra/api-keys.bicep -->

### Deploy with azd up

Move into the lab's folder, create an azd environment named `aigw-lab10` in your current subscription, then provision
everything. It takes about three minutes.

```bash title="Bash"
# Move into the lab's folder, which holds the azd project
cd ~/ai-gateway/labs/10-api-keys &&
  echo "📂 Lab folder: $(pwd)"

# Create an azd environment named aigw-lab10 in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab10 --location eastus2 --subscription "$(az account show --query id --output tsv)" &&
  echo "📝 azd environment aigw-lab10 deploys to eastus2"

# Provision the gateway, the Foundry model, its alias, and the runtime API keys
azd up &&
  echo "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Move into the lab's folder, which holds the azd project
Set-Location ~/ai-gateway/labs/10-api-keys
if ($?) { Write-Host "📂 Lab folder: $(Get-Location)" }

# Create an azd environment named aigw-lab10 in your current subscription, so that azd doesn't prompt you
azd env new aigw-lab10 --location eastus2 --subscription (az account show --query id --output tsv)
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 azd environment aigw-lab10 deploys to eastus2" }

# Provision the gateway, the Foundry model, its alias, and the runtime API keys
azd up
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚀 Gateway deployed: $(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)" }
```

For another region, pick one where AI Gateway and the `gpt-6-luna` model are available, as in [Find the available
regions](../SETUP.md#find-the-available-regions).

### Read the outputs and the key

Set the variables that the next sections and **Verify** use from azd's environment values, and read the `app-dev`
key from the gateway, so that it never shows on screen.

```bash title="Bash"
# Read azd's outputs into the variables that the next sections use, and set the management URL for the az rest calls
export RG="$(azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)"
export GATEWAY="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_NAME)"
export AI_GATEWAY_MODEL="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_MODEL)"
export API="api-version=2025-09-01-preview"
export GATEWAY_ID="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_ID)"
export GW="https://management.azure.com$GATEWAY_ID"
export AI_GATEWAY_URL="$(azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL)"
echo "📝 Gateway $GATEWAY in $RG, model alias $AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"
echo "🌐 Runtime URL: $AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Read the app-dev key from the gateway, so that it never lands in a file or a deployment log
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$(az aigateway api-key list-secrets --ids "$GATEWAY_ID/apiKeys/app-dev" \
  --query primaryKey --output tsv)"
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"

# List the gateway's keys and their state, without their values
echo "🔑 API keys on $GATEWAY:"
az aigateway api-key list -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" --query "[].{name:name, state:properties.state}" -o table
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Read azd's outputs into the variables that the next sections use, and set the management URL for the az rest calls
$RG                     = azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
$GATEWAY                = azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_NAME
$env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL   = azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_MODEL
$API                    = "api-version=2025-09-01-preview"
$GATEWAY_ID             = azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_ID
$GW                     = "https://management.azure.com$GATEWAY_ID"
$env:AI_GATEWAY_URL     = azd env get-value AI_GATEWAY_URL
Write-Host "📝 Gateway $GATEWAY in $RG, model alias $env:AI_GATEWAY_MODEL"
Write-Host "🌐 Runtime URL: $env:AI_GATEWAY_URL"

# Read the app-dev key from the gateway, so that it never lands in a file or a deployment log
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = az aigateway api-key list-secrets --ids "$GATEWAY_ID/apiKeys/app-dev" `
  --query primaryKey --output tsv
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"

# List the gateway's keys and their state, without their values
Write-Host "🔑 API keys on ${GATEWAY}:"
az aigateway api-key list -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY --query "[].{name:name, state:properties.state}" -o table
```

> **Checkpoint**
> `azd up` ended with `SUCCESS`. The table lists the built-in `master` key, the quick start's `app-first-call`,
> and `app-dev`, `support-bot`, and `old-notebook`, all `active`.

### Change the keys

The key names come from the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS` environment value, a JSON array, with the default in
`infra/main.parameters.json`. To add a key, set the whole list and provision again. Existing keys keep their values.

```bash title="Bash"
# Set the whole list of key names, with a new batch-job key at the end
azd env set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS '["app-dev","support-bot","old-notebook","batch-job"]' &&
  echo "📝 AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS lists four keys, with batch-job"

# Provision again: azd creates batch-job, and the existing keys keep their values
azd provision &&
  echo "🔑 API key batch-job is ready, and the other keys keep their values"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Set the whole list of key names, with a new batch-job key at the end
azd env set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS '["app-dev","support-bot","old-notebook","batch-job"]'
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS lists four keys, with batch-job" }

# Provision again: azd creates batch-job, and the existing keys keep their values
azd provision
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔑 API key batch-job is ready, and the other keys keep their values" }
```

Removing a name from the list doesn't delete the key: the deployment only creates and updates what the template
declares. Delete a key with the CLI, as in [Revoke a leaked key](#revoke-a-leaked-key).

<!-- /tracks -->

From the lab folder, send one request with the `app-dev` key:

```bash title="Bash"
# Send one request with the app-dev key: the script prints the HTTP status, and only the key's last four characters
echo "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the app-dev key:"
./infra/check-key.sh app-dev
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Send one request with the app-dev key: the script prints the HTTP status, and only the key's last four characters
Write-Host "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the app-dev key:"
./infra/check-key.ps1 -Label app-dev
```

The script sends a tiny Chat Completions request and prints only the last four characters of the key. On GitHub,
open [check-key.sh](infra/check-key.sh) or [check-key.ps1](infra/check-key.ps1).

<!-- include: infra/check-key.sh -->

> **Checkpoint**
> **Access** › **Keys** lists `app-dev`, `support-bot`, and `old-notebook`, and the check prints
> `HTTP 200  accepted` for `app-dev`.

## Store the key outside your code

A runtime key opens every model and MCP server on the gateway, so treat it like a password:

- **Local development:** set an environment variable for the session, as in this lab, and read it in code, for
  example `os.environ["AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY"]` in Python. If you keep it in a `.env` file, add the file to
  `.gitignore`.
- **Hosted apps:** keep the value in Azure Key Vault. App Service and Azure Functions resolve
  [Key Vault references](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) in app
  settings, and Azure Container Apps can
  [reference Key Vault secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/manage-secrets).
- **Pipelines:** use the secret store of your CI system, or read the value from Key Vault at run time.
- **Never** put the value in source code, a committed `.env` file, build logs, notebooks, chat, or tickets.

If you set `KEY_VAULT`, store the `app-dev` and `support-bot` values there. The commands print only the secret
IDs. Each secret is named `<key>-api-key`, which is the name the rotation script updates later.

```bash title="Bash"
# Copy the primary value of each key into a Key Vault secret named <key>-api-key, and print only the secret IDs
echo "🆔 Key Vault secret IDs:"
for KEY in app-dev support-bot; do
  az keyvault secret set --vault-name "$KEY_VAULT" -n "$KEY-api-key" \
    --value "$(az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n "$KEY" --query primaryKey -o tsv)" \
    --tags aigateway-key="$KEY" key-type=primary --query id -o tsv
done
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Copy the primary value of each key into a Key Vault secret named <key>-api-key, and print only the secret IDs
Write-Host "🆔 Key Vault secret IDs:"
foreach ($key in "app-dev", "support-bot") {
  $value = az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n $key --query primaryKey -o tsv
  az keyvault secret set --vault-name $KEY_VAULT -n "$key-api-key" --value $value `
    --tags aigateway-key=$key key-type=primary --query id -o tsv
}

# Clear the last key value from your session
Remove-Variable value
```

An app, or you, then reads the value from the vault instead of from the gateway:

```bash title="Bash"
# Read the app-dev value from Key Vault instead of from the gateway, without showing it
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name "$KEY_VAULT" -n app-dev-api-key --query value -o tsv)"
echo "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY (${#AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Read the app-dev value from Key Vault instead of from the gateway, without showing it
$env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY = az keyvault secret show --vault-name $KEY_VAULT -n app-dev-api-key --query value -o tsv
Write-Host "🔑 Key: in AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ($($env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

> [!NOTE]
> The portal track can store the values the same way: run the commands above, or add the secrets to the vault in
> the Azure portal.

## Rotate a key without downtime

Rotate keys on a schedule, and whenever someone who had a value leaves the team. Regenerating a value invalidates
that value only, and right away. The trick is to regenerate the value that no client is using.

On the Bicep + azd track, follow the **Azure CLI** track. A later `azd provision` keeps the regenerated values.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Save the current value

You use the old value later to prove that it stopped working. On the `support-bot` row, select **…**
(**More actions**) › **View keys**, copy the value, and paste it into your shell:

```bash title="Bash"
# Paste the current support-bot value without showing it, to prove later that the rotation retired it
read -rsp "Current support-bot value: " OLD_SUPPORT_BOT && echo
echo "🔑 Current support-bot value: in OLD_SUPPORT_BOT (${#OLD_SUPPORT_BOT} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Paste the current support-bot value without showing it, to prove later that the rotation retired it
$OLD_SUPPORT_BOT = Read-Host "Current support-bot value" -MaskInput
Write-Host "🔑 Current support-bot value: in OLD_SUPPORT_BOT ($($OLD_SUPPORT_BOT.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

### Rotate the key

1. On the `support-bot` row, select **…** (**More actions**) › **Rotate key**.
2. The `Rotate "support-bot" key?` dialog warns that the current value stops working immediately and that the
   new value is displayed once. Select **Rotate**.
3. In **API key rotated successfully**, copy the new value and update the client, or the `support-bot-api-key`
   secret in Key Vault.

> [!NOTE]
> The portal rotates the **primary** value in place, so a client that still sends the old value gets `401` until
> you update it. To rotate without downtime from the portal, replace the key instead: create `support-bot-v2`,
> move the client to it, and then delete `support-bot`. The new key is a new caller identity, so move any
> cost-limit overrides to it, and expect Monitoring to report it separately. The CLI track avoids both trade-offs
> with the secondary value.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Save the current value

Clients use the primary value today. Keep it so you can prove later that it stopped working:

```bash title="Bash"
# Save the primary value that clients use today, without showing it, to prove later that it stopped working
OLD_SUPPORT_BOT="$(az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n support-bot \
  --query primaryKey -o tsv)"
echo "🔑 Current primary value: in OLD_SUPPORT_BOT (${#OLD_SUPPORT_BOT} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Save the primary value that clients use today, without showing it, to prove later that it stopped working
$OLD_SUPPORT_BOT = az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n support-bot `
  --query primaryKey -o tsv
Write-Host "🔑 Current primary value: in OLD_SUPPORT_BOT ($($OLD_SUPPORT_BOT.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

### Regenerate the unused secondary value

No client uses the secondary value, so regenerating it breaks nothing:

```bash title="Bash"
# Regenerate the secondary value, which no client uses yet: the script shows only the last four characters of it
./infra/rotate-key.sh support-bot secondary &&
  echo "🔑 API key support-bot has a new secondary value, and clients on the primary keep working"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Regenerate the secondary value, which no client uses yet: the script shows only the last four characters of it
# To also update the support-bot-api-key secret, remove the # before -KeyVault
./infra/rotate-key.ps1 -ResourceGroup $RG -Gateway $GATEWAY -KeyName support-bot -KeyType secondary # -KeyVault $KEY_VAULT
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔑 API key support-bot has a new secondary value, and clients on the primary keep working" }
```

The script runs `az aigateway api-key regenerate --key-type secondary`, which replaces only the secondary value,
and reads the new value with `az aigateway api-key list-secrets`. It prints only the last four characters of the
new value. If `KEY_VAULT` is set in Bash, or you pass `-KeyVault` in PowerShell, it also
writes the new value to the `support-bot-api-key` secret. On GitHub, open [rotate-key.sh](infra/rotate-key.sh) or
[rotate-key.ps1](infra/rotate-key.ps1).

<!-- include: infra/rotate-key.sh -->

### Move the client to the secondary value

Update the client's configuration to the new secondary value and restart it, or let it reload the Key Vault
secret. Both values are valid now, so no request fails during the switch. The old primary value still works:

```bash title="Bash"
# Check that the old primary value still works, so that clients can move over without failed requests
echo "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the old primary value, until you regenerate it:"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$OLD_SUPPORT_BOT" ./infra/check-key.sh "old primary"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Check that the old primary value still works, so that clients can move over without failed requests
Write-Host "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the old primary value, until you regenerate it:"
./infra/check-key.ps1 -ApiKey $OLD_SUPPORT_BOT -Label "old primary"
```

### Regenerate the primary value

When every client uses the secondary value, regenerate the primary. This invalidates the old value, wherever it
might have been copied:

```bash title="Bash"
# Regenerate the primary value, so that the old value stops working wherever it was copied
./infra/rotate-key.sh support-bot primary &&
  echo "🔑 API key support-bot has a new primary value, and the old one stopped working"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Regenerate the primary value, so that the old value stops working wherever it was copied
# To also update the support-bot-api-key secret, remove the # before -KeyVault
./infra/rotate-key.ps1 -ResourceGroup $RG -Gateway $GATEWAY -KeyName support-bot -KeyType primary # -KeyVault $KEY_VAULT
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔑 API key support-bot has a new primary value, and the old one stopped working" }
```

Next time, rotate in the other direction: regenerate the primary, move clients to it, then regenerate the
secondary. With Key Vault, the secret always holds the newest value, so clients that reload it move along
automatically.

> **Checkpoint**
> `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$OLD_SUPPORT_BOT" ./infra/check-key.sh "rotated value"` (or
> `./infra/check-key.ps1 -ApiKey $OLD_SUPPORT_BOT -Label "rotated value"`) prints `HTTP 401`.

## Revoke a leaked key

When a key leaks, revoke it first and investigate afterward. Deleting a key invalidates both of its values
immediately, and anyone who holds them gets `401`. Pick one track.

On the Bicep + azd track, follow the **Azure CLI** track. Then remove `old-notebook` from the template's list, and
keep any names you added, so that a later `azd provision` doesn't create it again, with new values:

```bash title="Bash"
# Keep only the keys you still need in the list, so that a later azd provision doesn't create old-notebook again
azd env set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS '["app-dev","support-bot"]' &&
  echo "📝 AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS lists app-dev and support-bot"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Keep only the keys you still need in the list, so that a later azd provision doesn't create old-notebook again
azd env set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS '["app-dev","support-bot"]'
if ($?) { Write-Host "📝 AI_GATEWAY_API_KEYS lists app-dev and support-bot" }
```

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Save the leaked value

You use it to prove that the key no longer works. On the `old-notebook` row, select **…** (**More actions**) ›
**View keys**, copy the value, and paste it into your shell:

```bash title="Bash"
# Paste the leaked value without showing it, to prove later that the gateway rejects it
read -rsp "Leaked value: " LEAKED_KEY && echo
echo "🔑 Leaked value: in LEAKED_KEY (${#LEAKED_KEY} characters, not shown)"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Paste the leaked value without showing it, to prove later that the gateway rejects it
$LEAKED_KEY = Read-Host "Leaked value" -MaskInput
Write-Host "🔑 Leaked value: in LEAKED_KEY ($($LEAKED_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"
```

### Delete the key

Select the check box on the `old-notebook` row, and then select **Delete**. The `Delete "old-notebook" key?`
dialog warns that applications using the key will no longer authenticate to the gateway and that the action
can't be undone. Select **Delete**.

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Save the leaked value and delete the key

```bash title="Bash"
# Save the leaked primary value without showing it, to prove later that the gateway rejects it
LEAKED_KEY="$(az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n old-notebook \
  --query primaryKey -o tsv)"
echo "🔑 Leaked value: in LEAKED_KEY (${#LEAKED_KEY} characters, not shown)"

# Delete the key: both of its values stop working right away
az aigateway api-key delete -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n old-notebook --yes &&
  echo "🚮 API key old-notebook is deleted"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Save the leaked primary value without showing it, to prove later that the gateway rejects it
$LEAKED_KEY = az aigateway api-key list-secrets -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n old-notebook `
  --query primaryKey -o tsv
Write-Host "🔑 Leaked value: in LEAKED_KEY ($($LEAKED_KEY.Length) characters, not shown)"

# Delete the key: both of its values stop working right away
az aigateway api-key delete -g $RG --gateway-name $GATEWAY -n old-notebook --yes
if ($?) { Write-Host "🚮 API key old-notebook is deleted" }
```

### Suspend a key instead

To block a key while you investigate, without deleting it, set its `state` to `suspended`. Calls with the key
get `401` until you set it back to `active`. The **Verify** section expects `support-bot` to work, so set it
back to `active` before you continue. The `aigateway` extension can't change a key's state yet, so call the Azure
Resource Manager REST API with `az rest`:

```bash title="Bash"
# Suspend the support-bot key: calls with it get 401 until you set it back to active
STATE="$(az rest --method patch --url "$GW/apiKeys/support-bot?$API" \
  --body '{"properties":{"state":"suspended"}}' --query properties.state -o tsv)" &&
  echo "🔑 API key support-bot is $STATE"

# Later, set the key back to active, so that it works again
STATE="$(az rest --method patch --url "$GW/apiKeys/support-bot?$API" \
  --body '{"properties":{"state":"active"}}' --query properties.state -o tsv)" &&
  echo "🔑 API key support-bot is $STATE"
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Suspend the support-bot key: calls with it get 401 until you set it back to active
# The body goes in a file, so that PowerShell passes the JSON quotes to az intact
'{"properties":{"state":"suspended"}}' | Set-Content keystate.json
$STATE = az rest --method patch --url "$GW/apiKeys/support-bot?$API" --body "@keystate.json" --query properties.state -o tsv
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔑 API key support-bot is $STATE" }

# Later, set the key back to active, so that it works again
'{"properties":{"state":"active"}}' | Set-Content keystate.json
$STATE = az rest --method patch --url "$GW/apiKeys/support-bot?$API" --body "@keystate.json" --query properties.state -o tsv
if ($?) { Write-Host "🔑 API key support-bot is $STATE" }
Remove-Item keystate.json
```

The commands print the new state: `🔑 API key support-bot is suspended`, and then
`🔑 API key support-bot is active`.

<!-- /tracks -->

Then clean up after the leak: remove the value from the notebook and its history, and check
**Monitoring** for calls made with the key.

> [!NOTE]
> If the caller behind a leaked key must keep its identity, for example because a cost-limit override or
> Monitoring history is tied to it, regenerate **both** values instead of deleting the key. Run
> `./infra/rotate-key.sh <key> primary` and then `./infra/rotate-key.sh <key> secondary` (or the PowerShell
> script with `-KeyType`), and give the caller the new value.

## See usage and cost per key

Each key is a caller identity, so Monitoring can break usage down by key. This needs the monitoring setup from
[Monitor usage, cost, and traces](../13-monitoring/README.md) and a few requests with each key.

1. Select **Monitoring** › **Models**.
2. **Active caller identities** counts the API keys and Microsoft Entra identities with observed activity.
3. **Model usage by caller identity** compares caller identities by estimated model cost, tokens, and calls.
4. Use the **All caller identities** filter to scope the page to one key, for example `support-bot`. Keys appear
   by name, marked **API key**.

The same identity drives enforcement. A **Cost limit** counted by **Caller identity** gives each key its own
budget:

![A Cost limit policy with a $100 monthly budget counted by caller identity](../assets/screens/policy-cost-limit-details.png "A Cost limit counted by caller identity: each API key gets its own $100 monthly budget, and a caller that reaches it gets 403 LlmCostQuotaExceeded.")

To set budgets and limits per key, continue with
[Enforce cost budgets with per-caller overrides](../07-cost-budgets/README.md).

## When to move to Microsoft Entra ID

API keys are the fastest way to start, but the docs don't recommend them for production.

| | Runtime API key | Microsoft Entra ID with Azure RBAC |
|---|---|---|
| What the gateway sees | One named key | A user, agent, or workload identity in your tenant |
| What it can call | Every published model and MCP server | What its role grants: **AI Gateway User** (models and tools), **AI Gateway Models User**, or **AI Gateway Tools User**, at gateway, alias, or MCP server scope |
| Secret to protect | The key value | None with a managed identity; tokens are short-lived |
| Rotation | You rotate and redistribute values | Microsoft Entra ID issues new tokens |
| Good fit | Prototypes, labs, and tools that only accept a key | Production apps, agents, and per-user access |

Move to Microsoft Entra ID with
[Go keyless with Microsoft Entra ID and RBAC](../11-entra-rbac/README.md).

## Verify

Run the checks from the lab folder. Only current values should get through; the rotated value, the deleted key,
and a request without a key should all get `401`.

<!-- steps -->

### Load the app-dev key

If `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` no longer holds the `app-dev` value, load it again from Key Vault, with
`az aigateway api-key list-secrets`, or by pasting it, as in [Create a key for each app](#create-a-key-for-each-app).

### Run the checks

```bash title="Bash"
# Check the current app-dev key, which the gateway accepts
echo "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the app-dev key:"
./infra/check-key.sh app-dev

# Check the rotated value, the deleted key, and a request without a key: the gateway rejects all three
echo "🚦 Expect 401 Unauthorized for the rotated value, the deleted key, and no key:"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$OLD_SUPPORT_BOT" ./infra/check-key.sh "rotated value"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$LEAKED_KEY" ./infra/check-key.sh "deleted key"
./infra/check-key.sh --no-key
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Check the current app-dev key, which the gateway accepts
Write-Host "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the app-dev key:"
./infra/check-key.ps1 -Label app-dev

# Check the rotated value, the deleted key, and a request without a key: the gateway rejects all three
Write-Host "🚦 Expect 401 Unauthorized for the rotated value, the deleted key, and no key:"
./infra/check-key.ps1 -ApiKey $OLD_SUPPORT_BOT -Label "rotated value"
./infra/check-key.ps1 -ApiKey $LEAKED_KEY -Label "deleted key"
./infra/check-key.ps1 -NoKey
```

Expected output (your key endings differ):

```text
🔑 Expect 200 OK for the app-dev key:
app-dev        ...Q7xk  HTTP 200  accepted
🚦 Expect 401 Unauthorized for the rotated value, the deleted key, and no key:
rotated value  ...m2Rd  HTTP 401  rejected: the key is missing, invalid, rotated, suspended, or deleted
deleted key    ...Vt9a  HTTP 401  rejected: the key is missing, invalid, rotated, suspended, or deleted
no key         -        HTTP 401  rejected: the key is missing, invalid, rotated, suspended, or deleted
```

### Check that the rotated key still works

Load a current `support-bot` value from **View keys**, Key Vault, or `az aigateway api-key list-secrets`, and run
the check again. After the CLI flow, both the new primary and the new secondary value work. The check prints
`HTTP 200`:

```bash title="Bash"
# Paste a current support-bot value without showing it
read -rsp "Current support-bot value: " SUPPORT_BOT && echo
echo "🔑 Current support-bot value: in SUPPORT_BOT (${#SUPPORT_BOT} characters, not shown)"

# Check it: after the rotation, the gateway accepts both the new primary and the new secondary value
echo "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the current support-bot value:"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="$SUPPORT_BOT" ./infra/check-key.sh support-bot
```

```powershell title="PowerShell"
# Paste a current support-bot value without showing it
$SUPPORT_BOT = Read-Host "Current support-bot value" -MaskInput
Write-Host "🔑 Current support-bot value: in SUPPORT_BOT ($($SUPPORT_BOT.Length) characters, not shown)"

# Check it: after the rotation, the gateway accepts both the new primary and the new secondary value
Write-Host "🔑 Expect 200 OK for the current support-bot value:"
./infra/check-key.ps1 -ApiKey $SUPPORT_BOT -Label support-bot
```

<!-- /steps -->

## Go further

- **Prompt for the key in MCP clients.** VS Code can ask for the key when it starts an MCP server instead of
  storing it in `mcp.json`. See [Federate MCP tools behind one endpoint](../04-federate-mcp-tools/README.md).
- **Get a rotation reminder.** Set an expiry date on the Key Vault secret with
  `az keyvault secret set-attributes --expires`, and subscribe to the vault's `SecretNearExpiry` event.
- **Automate rotation.** Run the rotation script from a scheduled pipeline that signs in with a workload
  identity, with a pause between the secondary and primary steps for clients to reload.
- **Limit each key.** Give every key its own token allowance with
  [Throttle tokens per caller with token limits](../06-token-limits/README.md).

## Clean up

Keep `app-dev` and `support-bot`:
[Enforce cost budgets with per-caller overrides](../07-cost-budgets/README.md) gives them different budgets.

<!-- track: portal | Portal -->

### Delete the test keys

Delete any other keys you created for testing, such as `support-bot-v2`, in **Access** › **Keys** (check box,
then **Delete**).

<!-- track: cli | Azure CLI -->

### Delete the test keys

Delete any other keys you created for testing, such as `support-bot-v2`:

```bash
# Delete a test key, for example support-bot-v2 from the portal's rotation
az aigateway api-key delete -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$GATEWAY" -n support-bot-v2 --yes &&
  echo "🚮 API key support-bot-v2 is deleted"
```

<!-- track: iac | Bicep + azd -->

### Delete everything azd created

In the `ai-gateway/labs/10-api-keys` folder, delete the resource group with the gateway, the Foundry account, and the
keys. [`--purge`](../SETUP.md#delete-what-azd-created) also purges the soft-deleted Foundry account. It takes about
ten minutes.

```bash
# Delete everything that azd up created, and purge the Foundry account
azd down --purge --force &&
  echo "🚮 Everything that azd up created is deleted"
```

The Bicep + azd track of lab 07 creates its own `app-dev` and `support-bot` keys, so you don't need to keep these.

<!-- /tracks -->

If you created a Key Vault only for this lab, delete it. Key Vault keeps deleted vaults for a retention period
and reserves the name; purge it if you want to reuse the name right away:

```bash
# Delete the vault: Key Vault keeps it for a retention period, and reserves its name
az keyvault delete -n "$KEY_VAULT" &&
  echo "🚮 Key Vault is deleted, and its name stays reserved until you purge it"

# Purge the deleted vault, so that you can reuse its name right away
az keyvault purge -n "$KEY_VAULT" &&
  echo "🚮 Key Vault is purged"
```

Clear the key values from your shell with `unset AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY OLD_SUPPORT_BOT LEAKED_KEY SUPPORT_BOT`
(Bash) or `Remove-Variable OLD_SUPPORT_BOT, LEAKED_KEY, SUPPORT_BOT; Remove-Item Env:AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
(PowerShell). Delete the gateway from earlier labs only when you finish all labs, as described in
[Provision your AI Gateway](../01-provision-gateway/README.md#clean-up). `azd down` doesn't touch it, because the
Bicep + azd track created its own gateway.
